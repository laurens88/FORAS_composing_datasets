Central to the diagnosis of PTSD is exposure to trauma, which is necessary (but not sufficient) for diagnosis. The characteristic features of PTSD include intrusive symptoms such as nightmares or flashbacks, avoidance behaviors, symptoms of hyperarousal and reactivity, and disturbances of mood and cognition. Differential diagnoses of PTSD to rule out are explored. Lastly, the chapter discusses the two most commonly used tools that assist in the diagnosis of PTSD: PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale 5 (CAPS-5). The PCL-5 is much briefer and is most used to screen for PTSD and monitor treatment response, while the CAPS-5 is a gold standard for establishing a diagnosis for PTSD. Both are helpful research tools or in clinical care. However, in clinical care, PCL-5 is more commonly used than CAPS-5 due to its brevity, which renders it more practical clinically.",0

The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is the most widely used structured clinical interview and recognized as the golden standard in PTSD diagnosis. The final revision of the clinical interview form as the CAPS for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) was advanced in line with the recent revisions in DSM-5 with regards to the PTSD definition. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of CAPS-5 in clinical samples and healthy controls.Methods: In the present study, 30 inpatients with PTSD and 30 inpatients with major depressive disorder consecutively presented to the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic Yüzüncü Yıl University Research Hospital, and 30 healthy controls were enrolled. All participants were included if only they reported an index trauma in the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) that bothered them during the past month. Subjects were administered a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) along with the LEC-5, CAPS-5 and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). We used confirmatory factor analysis to compare a structured clinical interview (CAPS-5) and a self-report measure, the PCL-5 and to examine DSM-5 implied four-symptom clusters and several factor structures proposed in the literature to understand which model best represents the latent factor structure of PSTD symptoms. Using multivariate analysis of covariance, concurrent validity of both self-report and structured clinical interview was evaluated. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was utilized to obtain an optimal cut-off value of the PCL-5 scores in order to use in demarcating cases with non-cases.Results: Even though DSM-5 implied four-factor model adequately fit to either data collected using self-report or clinician-administered measures of PTSD, the latent structure of PTSD symptoms measured by either CAPS-5 or PCL-5 were best represented by six-factor Externalizing Behaviors model, particularly compared to seven-factor Hybrid model. In comparison to depressive and control groups, PTSD patients reported greater scores on the PCL-5, DES, BDI, and BAI and McNemar χ2 values between two applications with two weeks interval were unsubstantial. Additionally, PTSD patients exhibited greater symptom endorsement on B, C, D, E, F, G symptom clusters and dissociative subtype than depressive patients and controls. Using signal detection analysis, a significant area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the PCL-5 (AUC = 0.87 p < 0.001 asymptotic 95% Confidence Interval = 0.798–0.942). The PCL-5 had excellent diagnostic utility with 0.90 sensitivity and 0.80 specificity on a cut-off score ≥47.Conclusion: Turkish versions of the CAPS-5 and PCL-5 are demonstrated to have very good psychometric properties. Implications regarding the findings are discussed.",2

Brief and self-reported validated measures for assessing PTSD symptom severity are necessary to improve care access and assess disorder progress and treatment response. Therefore, we evaluated the psychometric properties of the PTSD-Checklist for the DSM-5 (PCL-5) of 20-, 8- and 4-item in patients that sought specialized mental health services after a catastrophic earthquake that stroke Mexico on September 19th, 2017. The internal consistency of 20-, 8- and 4-item PCL-5 was adequate (≥.7). Using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) as a reference, signal detection analyses revealed a PCL-5 score of 27 as optimal (sensitivity = .96, specificity = .73) for identifying probable PTSD cases. The shortened versions highly correlated with the full PCL-5 and had comparable diagnostic utility. Our results indicate that the 20-item PCL-5 and the abridged versions can effectively identify possible PTSD cases. The 8-item version has better psychometric properties and more consistent diagnostic utility across time and civil populations. These measures must be evaluated in independent samples to corroborate their utility in different populations and regarding diverse traumatic events.",3

Although scores from these assessment modalities are strongly associated, they are often discrepant for individual symptoms, total symptom severity, and diagnostic status. To date, no known studies have empirically identified the sources of these discrepancies. In the present study, we had three aims: (a) replicate previously identified discrepancies; (b) examine contribution of possible objective predictors of discrepancies, including negative response bias, random responding, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and verbal IQ; and (c) identify subjective sources of discrepancies through analysis of participant feedback. Trauma-exposed undergraduates (N = 60) were administered the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), and other questionnaires. Interviewers identified discrepancies between corresponding PCL-5/CAPS-5 scores and asked participants to describe their attributions for discrepancies. Discrepancies, both dimensional and dichotomous, occurred at the item, cluster, and total score level. Objective predictors were weakly associated with discrepancies. The most commonly reported reasons for discrepancies were time-frame reminders, comprehension of symptoms, trauma-related attribution errors, increased awareness, and general errors. These findings help explain discordance between the PCL-5 and CAPS-5, and inform use and interpretation of these two widely used PTSD measures in clinical and research applications.",4

Thus, the PCL in its existing form may not provide a comprehensive appraisal of posttraumatic symptomatology. Because of this, we modified the PCL to create the PCL-I/F that measures both frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms via brief self-report. To establish validity and internal consistency of the PCL-I/F, we conducted a pilot study comparing PCL-I/F scores to structured diagnostic interview for PTSD (the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS]) in a male combat veteran sample of 92 participants. Statistically significant correlations between the PCL-I/F and the CAPS were found, suggesting initial validation of the PCL-I/F to screen and assess frequency and intensity of combat-related PTSD symptoms. Implications are discussed for screening and assessment of PTSD related to combat and non-combat trauma.",5

There is initial evidence that therapist-assisted internet-based psychological treatments are effective for PTSD and may help increase access, but it remains unclear which of these treatments work best and are most acceptable to patients. This randomised controlled trial will compare a trauma-focussed and a nontrauma-focussed therapist-assisted cognitive behavioural Internet treatment for PTSD: Internet-delivered cognitive therapy for PTSD (iCT-PTSD) and internet-delivered stress management therapy (iStress-PTSD).The study is a single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing iCT-PTSD, iStress-PTSD and a 13-week wait-list condition, with an embedded process study. Assessors of treatment outcome will be blinded to trial arm. Two hundred and seventeen participants who meet DSM-5 criteria for PTSD will be randomly allocated by a computer programme to iCT-PTSD, iStress-PTSD or wait-list at a 3:3:1 ratio. The primary assessment point is at 13 weeks, and further assessments are taken at 6, 26, 39 and 65 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Secondary measures of PTSD symptoms are the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Other symptoms and well-being will be assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), WHO (Five) Well-Being Index, Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Endicott Quality of Life Scale (QoL), and Insomnia Sleep Index (ISI). Health economics analyses will consider quality of life, productivity, health resource utilisation, employment status and state benefits, and treatment delivery costs. Process analyses will investigate candidate mediators and moderators of outcome. Patient experience will be assessed by interview and questionnaire.This study will be the first to compare the efficacy of a trauma-focussed and nontrauma-focussed therapist-assisted online cognitive behavioural treatment for people with posttraumatic stress disorder.ISRCTN16806208.

To date, there has been little study of these properties within UK veteran populations. Objective: This study aimed to determine optimally efficient cut-off values for the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) that can be used to assess for differential diagnosis of presumptive PTSD. Methods: Data from a sample of 242 UK veterans assessed for mental health difficulties were analysed. The criterion-related validity of the PCL-5 and IES-R were evaluated against the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Kappa statistics were used to assess the level of agreement between the DSM-IV and DSM-5 classification systems. Results: The optimal cut-off scores observed within this sample were 34 or above on the PCL-5 and 46 or above on the IES-R. The PCL-5 cut-off is similar to the previously reported values, but the IES-R cut-off identified in this study is higher than has previously been recommended. Overall, a moderate level of agreement was found between participants screened positive using the DSM-IV and DSM-5 classification systems of PTSD. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the PCL-5 and IES-R can be used as brief measures within veteran populations presenting at secondary care to assess for PTSD. The use of a higher cut-off for the IES-R may be helpful for differentiating between veterans who present with PTSD and those who may have some sy`mptoms of PTSD but are sub-threshold for meeting a diagnosis. Further, the use of more accurate optimal cut-offs may aid clinicians to better monitor changes in PTSD symptoms during and after treatment.Planteamiento: La investigación previa que exploró las propiedades psicométricas de las puntuaciones de las medidas del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) sugiere que existe una variación en su funcionamiento según la población objetivo. Hasta la fecha, ha habido pocos estudios sobre estas propiedades dentro de las poblaciones de veteranos del Reino Unido. Objetivo: Este estudio tuvo como objetivo determinar valores de corte óptimamente eficientes para la escala revisada del impacto de los eventos (IES-R, siglas en inglés de Impact of Event Scale-Revised) y la lista de TEPT para el DSM-5 (PCL-5, siglas en inglés de PTSD Checklist for DSM-5) que pueden utilizarse para evaluar el diagnóstico diferencial de TEPT presuntivo. Métodos: Se analizaron los datos de una muestra de 242 veteranos del Reino Unido evaluados por dificultades de salud mental. La validez relacionada con los criterios del PCL-5 y la IES-R se evaluó frente a la Escala de TEPT administrada por el clínico para el DSM-5 (CAPS-5, siglas en inglés de Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5). Se usaron estadísticas Kappa para evaluar el nivel de acuerdo entre los sistemas de clasificación del DSM-IV y DSM-5. Resultados: Las puntuaciones de corte óptimos observadas dentro de esta muestra fueron de 34 o más en la PCL-5 y de 46 o más en la IES-R. El límite de la PCL-5 es similar a los valores informados anteriormente, pero el punto de corte IES-R identificado en este estudio es más alto de lo que se había recomendado anteriormente. En general, se encontró un nivel moderado de acuerdo entre los participantes seleccionados con los sistemas de clasificación DSM-IV y DSM-5 para el TEPT. Conclusiones: Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que la PCL-5 y la IES-R pueden usarse como medidas breves en poblaciones de veteranos que se presentan en el sistema sanitario secundario para evaluar el TEPT. El uso de un punto de corte más alto para la IES-R puede ser útil para diferenciar entre los veteranos que presentan TEPT y aquellos que pueden presentar algunos síntomas de TEPT, pero que están por debajo del umbral y no cumplen con el diagnóstico. Además, el uso de puntos de corte óptimos más precisos puede ayudar a los clínios a controlar mejor los cambios en los síntomas de TEPT durante y después del tratamiento.背景：探索创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）测量分数的心理测量特性的前人研究建议，根据不同目标群体测量分数的表现具有变异性。目前为止，很少有研究在英国老兵群体里考察这些特性。 目标：本研究目的是要决定事件影响量表修订版（IES-R）和DSM-5 PTSD检核表（PCL-5）的划界分，用来评估不同PTSD诊断。 方法：使用242名英国老兵评估精神健康的数据，将PCL-5和IES-R与CAPS-5对比得出诊断标准相关效度。使用Kappa系数来评估DSM-IV和DSM-5分类系统的一致性。 结果：本样本中PCL-5最好的划界分是34或以上，IES-R是46或以上。PCL-5划界分和之前报告值相近，但是IES-R则高于以往推荐的数值。总体上，使用DSM-IV和DSM-5的PTSD分类系统表现出中等一致性。 结论：我们的发现建议PCL-5和IES-R可以用在二级护理的老兵群体中作为评估PTSD的简要工具。使用更高的IES-R划界分可以有助于区分有PTSD和可能具有一些症状但还在达不到PTSD诊断阈值的老兵。进一步，使用更准备的最佳划界分可能帮助临床医生更好监控PTSD症状在治疗中和治疗后的改变。.",7

Because of the high symptom overlap between PTSD and pain, it is particularly important to validate PTSD screening tools in trauma-exposed chronic pain patients.Objective: The present study is the first seeking to validate the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in a sample of trauma-exposed, treatment-seeking chronic pain patients.Method: The validation and optimal scoring of the PCL-5 were investigated using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) in chronic pain patients exposed to traffic or work-related traumas (n = 84). Construct validity was investigated using confirmatory factor analyses testing six competing DSM-5 models in a sample of mixed trauma-exposed chronic pain patients (n = 566), and a subsample of chronic pain patients exposed to traffic or work-related trauma only (n = 202). Furthermore, concurrent validity and discriminant validity were investigated using correlation analysis.Results: The results showed moderate (κ = .46) diagnostic consistency between the PCL-5 and the CAPS-5 using the DSM-5 symptom cluster criteria, and the overall accuracy of the scale (area under the curve = .79) was highly acceptable. Furthermore, the Danish PCL-5 showed excellent construct validity both in the full sample and in the subsample of traffic and work-related accidents, with superior fit of the seven-factor hybrid model. Excellent concurrent validity and discriminant validity were also established in the full sample.Conclusion: The PCL-5 appears to have satisfactory psychometric properties in trauma-exposed, treatment-seeking chronic pain patients.The present study is the first seeking to validate the PCL-5 using the CAPS-5 in chronic pain patients following traffic and work-related injury.The results showed moderate diagnostic consistency and acceptable overall accuracy using the DSM-5 criteria.Excellent construct, concurrent, and discriminant validity was established in chronic pain patients following mixed traumatic exposure and traffic and work-related trauma only.",9
https://openalex.org/W2907587603,10.1002/da.22873,Detecting PTSD in a traumatically injured population: The diagnostic utility of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5,"Background The posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is among few validated measures of PTSD severity in line with the DSM-5. Validation efforts among veteran samples have recommended cut scores of 33 and 38 to indicate PTSD; cut scores vary across populations depending on factors such as trauma type. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of and identify optimal cut scores for the PCL-5 in relation to the gold standard Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) among traumatically injured individuals 6 months after discharge from a level I trauma center. Methods A total of 251 participants completed the PCL-5 and CAPS-5 6 months after discharge from a level I trauma center following traumatic injury. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses detailed diagnostic accuracy of the PCL-5 and identified the optimal cut score via Youden's J index. Cut scores were also broken down by intentional versus nonintentional injury. Results The PCL-5 produces satisfactory diagnostic accuracy, with adequate sensitivity and specificity, in a traumatically injured population. Estimates indicate the optimal cut score as >30; the optimal cut score for intentional injuries was >34 and >22 for nonintentional injuries. Conclusions This investigation provides support for the PCL-5 in detection of PTSD among injured individuals 6 months after discharge from a level I trauma center. PCL-5 specificity and sensitivity suggest clinicians working with this population can feel confident in using this measure over more onerous structured interviews (e.g., CAPS-5). This study signifies a move toward ensuring those experiencing mental health difficulties after traumatic injury are identified and connected to resources.",10

Participants were recruited within a large multicenter patient cohort study on long-term sequelae of sepsis. Adult patients (n = 83) on average four months after intensive care of (severe) sepsis or septic shock were included (median age 64 years, 60% male). PTSD symptom severity was assessed by three different self-report measures: two versions of the Posttraumatic Stress Scale (PTSS-10; PTSS-14), and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). A clinical PTSD diagnosis was derived by using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Ten patients (12%) were diagnosed with PTSD. PTSS-10, PTSS-14, and PCL-5 revealed good reliability and concurrent validity. PTSS-14 showed the best accuracy in screening patients at risk for PTSD after intensive care with 80% sensitivity and 92% specificity at the recommended cutoff of 40. Compared to PTSS-10 and PCL-5, PTSS-14 appeared more appropriate for post-ICU PTSD screening when validated against a DSM-5 diagnostic interview.",11

While the CAPS corresponds with PTSD criteria according to the DSM-5, researchers face a challenge with the forthcoming ICD-11: ICD-11 introduces the new diagnosis Complex PTSD (CPTSD) that does not exist in DSM-5.Objective: Researchers as well as clinicians will need to assess the incidence and prevalence of CPTSD and will want to evaluate treatment effects according to both criteria sets. However, using two clinician-rated interviews is often not feasible and a burden to patients, particularly in psychotherapy research.Method & Results: We have therefore developed the Complex PTSD Item Set additional to the CAPS (COPISAC). This clinician rating is an easy-to-use and economic addition to the CAPS that permits assessing diagnosis and evaluating symptom severity of CPTSD. COPISAC consists of three items that assess disturbances in self-regulation including prompts for symptom description and frequency, and two additional items assessing impairment. Diagnostic status and severity ratings for CPTSD are possible. Items that account for the specific forms of trauma which the ICD-11 describes as precursors of CPTSD (e.g. torture, being enslaved) are further suggested as additions to the Life Events Checklist.Conclusion: With an introduction of COPISAC at this point, we aim at suggesting an easy transition into diagnosing CPTSD and evaluating its course over treatment.The clinician rating COPISAC is an easy-to-use and economic addition to the Clinician-administered PTSD Scale.It permits to make a diagnosis of Complex PTSD and evaluate symptom severity.",13

Research has shown that PTSS that emerged within days of trauma was a robust predictor of PTSD development.To investigate patterns of early stress responses to trauma and their associations with development of PTSD.We recruited 247 civilian trauma survivors from a local hospital emergency department. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were completed within 2 weeks after the traumatic event. Additionally, 3 months post-trauma 146 of these participants completed a PTSD diagnostic interview using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5.We first used latent profile analysis on four symptom clusters of the PCL-5 and the dissociation symptom cluster of the ASDS and determined that a four-profile model ('severe symptoms', 'moderate symptoms', 'mild symptoms', 'minimal symptoms') was optimal based on multiple fit indices. Gender was found to be predictive of profile membership. We then found a significant association between subgroup membership and PTSD diagnosis (χ2(3) = 11.85, P < 0.01, Cramer's V = 0.263). Post hoc analysis revealed that this association was driven by participants in the 'severe symptoms' profile, who had a greater likelihood of developing PTSD.These findings fill the knowledge gap of identifying possible subgroups of individuals based on their PTSS severity during the early post-trauma period and investigating the relationship between subgroup membership and PTSD development, which have important implications for clinical practice.",14

This study examined the psychometric properties of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in a sample of 133 firefighters/emergency medical technicians and police officers seeking treatment for PTSD. The results indicated that PCL-5 scores showed strong internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity. Signal detection analyses indicated a good diagnostic accuracy and an optimal cutoff score of 41 for detecting PTSD. Consistent with recent studies, confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the anhedonia model of PTSD best fit the data. Overall, findings support use of the PCL-5 as a psychometrically sound measure of PTSD in individuals at high risk for exposure to trauma.",15

However, such reports may be affected by a respondent's most intense (""peak"") or most recent (""end"") symptoms. The present study evaluated the correspondence between PTSD symptoms assessed using a standard past-month retrospective rating scale and recorded by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) over the same period and tested hypotheses that retrospective scores would be predicted by peak and end-period momentary symptoms. Male U.S. veterans (N = 35) who served post-9/11 completed the PTSD Symptom Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) at baseline and 1 month later. For 28 days during the intervening period, they received quasi-randomly timed text prompts to complete a modified version of the PCL-5 at that moment. Using multiple regression modeling, controlling for the number of completed EMAs and time (days) since the last EMA, we assessed the predictability of follow-up retrospective PCL-5 scores by (a) the mean of all momentary scores and (b) peak and last-day momentary scores. Retrospective PCL-5 scores were closest to peak scores, d = -0.31, and substantially higher than overall mean, d = 0.99, and last-day momentary scores, d = 0.94. In the regression model, peak symptom experiences and last-day momentary symptoms uniquely predicted follow-up PCL-5 scores over and above significant prediction by overall mean momentary symptom scores. In sum, participants' self-reported past-month PTSD symptom severity did not simply reflect an average over time. Additional questioning is needed to understand peak and recent symptom periods reflected in these estimates.",17

Several changes to PTSD definition were made in the recent revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The aim of the study was to assess psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the revised version conforming to the advances in DSM-5.Method: Psychiatric outpatients with PTSD (n = 29) and major depressive disorder (n = 73) and a community group (n = 360) included in the study. Respondents completed the PCL-5, Trauma Symptom Checklist-40, Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, Dissociative Experiences Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory and Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory.Results: We found a four-factor solution best fit to the data providing support for the vast array of PTSD research. The PCL-5 demonstrated good reliability with composite reliability coefficients of re-experiencing (.79–.92), avoidance (.73–.91), negative alterations (.85–.90) and hyper-arousal (.81–.88) and temporal reliability with two-week test retest intra-correlation coefficients of .70, .64, .78, and .76, respectively. Strong associations of the total and sub-scale scores of the PCL-5 with other measures of trauma-related symptoms were indicative of construct validity of the screening tool. The current investigation suggested a cut-off score ≥47 for PTSD diagnosis, with .76 sensitivity and .69 specificity.Conclusion: The PCL-5 is a promising screening tool with sound psychometric properties.",20

Internal consistencies and test-retest reliability were computed. To investigate diagnostic accuracy, we calculated receiver operating curves. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were performed to analyze the structural validity.Results showed high internal consistency (α = .95), high test-retest reliability (r = .91) and a high correlation with the total severity score of the CAPS-5, r = .77. In addition, the recommended cutoff of 33 on the PCL-5 showed high diagnostic accuracy when compared to the diagnosis established by the CAPS-5. CFAs comparing the DSM-5 model with alternative models (the three-factor solution, the dysphoria, anhedonia, externalizing behavior and hybrid model) to account for the structural validity of the PCL-5 remained inconclusive.Overall, the findings show that the German PCL-5 is a reliable instrument with good diagnostic accuracy.

Besides depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly encountered in civilian and military populations. As more prospective and retrospective studies - focused on evaluating new or old psychological therapies in inpatient, outpatient, or controlled environments, targeting patients with PTSD with or without a history of TBI - are carried out, researchers are employing various scales to measure PTSD as well as other psychiatric diagnoses or cognitive impairments that might appear following TBI. We aimed to explore the literature published between January 2010 and October 2021 by querying three databases. Our preliminary results showed that several scales - such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Military Version (PCL-M) as well as Specific Version (PCL-S), and Civilian Version (PCL-C) - have been frequently used for PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity. However, heterogeneity in the scales used when assessing and evaluating additional psychiatric comorbidities and cognitive impairments are due to the study aim and therapeutic approaches. Therefore, conducting an intervention focusing on post-TBI PTSD patients requires increased attention to patients' medical history in capturing multiple cognitive impairments and affected neuropsychological processes when designing the study and including validated instruments for measuring primary and secondary neuropsychological outcomes.",23

The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), was used initially to screen patients for PTSD for a provisional diagnosis. These provisionally diagnosed patients were then subjected to a structured interview by a Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). The PTSD status outcome of PCL-5 and CAPS-5 were correlated. PTSD was compared among patients with different types of facial fractures/injuries and also compared based on their anatomic location. The reliability of PCL-5 scale in relation to the structured CAPS-5 was assessed and the specificity was found to be 71.4%. Patients with both aesthetic and functional deformity exhibited greater severity of injury and showed higher incidence of PTSD with higher conversion rate from the 1st month to 3rd month. The frequency of PTSD in deformities with higher severity like zygomaticomaxillary complex injuries was found to be statistically significant.A high incidence of PTSD is associated with maxillofacial trauma and early detection is essential.",24

Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) was included in ICD-11 as a new trauma-related disorder which could develop following prolonged or reoccurring traumatic experiences. Research on ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD validity and epidemiology has, so far, mostly been conducted in adult population. This is the first study to explore the construct validity of the Child and Adolescent version of International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ-CA) as a measure of ICD-11 CPTSD symptoms. The study was based on a sample of 932 adolescents from the general population aged 12–16 (M = 14.25, SD = 1.27) years exposed to various traumatic experiences. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and latent class analysis (LCA) to test validity of the ITQ-CA scores from adolescents. The best fitting measurement model included six correlated factors representing the three PTSD and three DSO symptom clusters. LCA analysis revealed four classes whose symptom profiles were reflective of ‘CPTSD’, ‘PTSD’, ‘DSO only’, and ‘Baseline’.

The aim of this study was to develop a crosswalk between the DSM‐IV and DSM‐5 versions of the PTSD Checklist (PCL), a widely used self‐rated measure of PTSD symptom severity. Participants were 1,003 U.S. veterans (58.7% with PTSD) who completed the PCL for DSM‐IV (the PCL‐C) and DSM‐5 (the PCL‐5) during their participation in an ongoing longitudinal registry study. In a randomly selected training sample ( n = 800), we used equipercentile equating with loglinear smoothing to compute a “crosswalk” between PCL‐C and PCL‐5 scores. We evaluated the correspondence between the crosswalk‐determined predicted scores and observed PCL‐5 scores in the remaining validation sample ( n = 203). The results showed strong correspondence between crosswalk‐predicted PCL‐5 scores and observed PCL‐5 scores in the validation sample, ICC = .96. Predicted PCL‐5 scores performed comparably to observed PCL‐5 scores when examining their agreement with PTSD diagnosis ascertained by clinical interview: predicted PCL‐5, κ = 0.57; observed PCL‐5, κ = 0.59. Subsample comparisons indicated that the crosswalk's accuracy did not differ across characteristics including gender, age, racial minority status, and PTSD status. The results support the validity of this newly developed PCL‐C to PCL‐5 crosswalk in a veteran sample, providing a tool with which to interpret and translate scores across the two measures.",27

However, such fluctuations are typically short ranged and have rarely been investigated over the course of decades after the trauma. Moreover, existing studies have used a variety of measurements, either employing a categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-oriented approach or a continuous measure of symptom severity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the two methods of analyzing trajectories of PTSD by examining the level of concordance between them, their sensitivity, and their validity. Method: A total of 349 Israeli veterans from the 1973 Yom Kippur War were examined at four time points over more than four decades since the war. A latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was conducted to identify different PTSD trajectories, using both categorical and continuous PTSD assessments. Results: Descriptive results revealed that the four commonly observed patterns of PTSD are insufficient for capturing the range of individual PTSD trajectories. Using a categorical measure in the explorative LCGA yielded three trajectories (resilient, chronic, and delayed onset). The continuous measure yielded five trajectories (resilient, chronic, recovered, and two delayed-onset trajectories), which provided a slightly more nuanced distinction of participants’ distress-induced psychosocial dysfunction as compared to the three-trajectory solution. Conclusion: These findings suggest that using a continuous PTSD trajectory measure provides a somewhat more sensitive estimation of PTSD trajectories. More specifically, taking into consideration symptom intensity and fluctuation over time may provide a more comprehensive picture of the survivors’ distress.",28

We collected data from 500 sequential patients at the beginning and end of treatment, evaluating the PCL-5 factor structure followed by psychometric analyses. Results align with recent research following rigorous methods and advanced statistical techniques in suggesting a unidimensional factor structure for the PCL-5, with indications for its items representing a general factor with no clear support for multiple factors or subscales aligned with specific symptom clusters. In addition, psychometric analyses suggest a wider range of potential cutoff scores predicting PTSD diagnosis that may be specific to this population or setting. Given the remaining research questions surrounding the PCL-5 and its structure and functioning specifically, as well as the evolving conceptualizations of PTSD as a psychological disorder, further research is needed to guide clinical practice and future research.

The PCL-5 was developed to assess for DSM-5 PTSD. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PCL-5 in a sample of trauma-exposed mental health service users who were evidencing symptoms of PTSD. Method: Reliability and validity of the PCL-5 were investigated in a sample of 273 participants who reported past diagnosis for PTSD or who had screened positively for traumatic stress symptoms. Diagnostic utility was evaluated in comparison to the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Results: The PCL-5 demonstrated high internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity, acceptable stability and good diagnostic utility. However, operating characteristics differed from those found in other samples. Scores of 43-44 provided optimal efficiency for diagnosing PTSD. A post hoc regression analysis showed that depression explained more of the variance in PCL-5 total score than the CAPS-5. Conclusion: Whilst the PCL-5 is psychometrically sound it appears to have difficulty differentiating self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms from PTSD in trauma-exposed mental health service users and clinicians should take care to assess full symptomatology when individuals screen positively on the PCL-5. Clinicians and researchers should also take care not to assume that operating characteristics of self-report PTSD measures are valid for mental health service users, when these have been established in other populations.Antecedentes: Las mediciones auto reportadas para el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) se emplean con frecuencia en los servicios de salud mental pero muy pocas han sido evaluadas en muestras clínicas que incluyan a civiles. Se desarrolló la lista de chequeo de los síntomas del trastorno de estrés postraumático (PCL-5, por sus siglas en inglés) para la evaluación de los síntomas del TEPT según el DSM-5.Objetivo: El objetivo del estudio fue evaluar las propiedades psicométricas de la PCL-5 en una muestra de usuarios de servicios de salud mental expuestos a trauma y que mostraban síntomas del TEPT.Métodos: Se investigaron la confiabilidad y la validez de la PCL-5 en una muestra de 273 participantes que reportaron un diagnóstico previo de TEPT o que fueron tamizados como positivos para síntomas de estrés traumático. La utilidad diagnóstica se evaluó mediante la comparación con la escala para el TEPT administrada por un clínico según el DSM-5 (CAPS-5, por sus siglas en inglés).Resultados: La PCL-5 mostró alta consistencia interna, buena convergencia y validez divergente, estabilidad aceptable y buena utilidad diagnóstica. Sin embargo, las características operativas eran distintas de aquellas encontradas en otras muestras. Un puntaje entre 43 y 44 puntos tenía una eficiencia óptima para el diagnóstico del TEPT. Un análisis post hoc mostró que la depresión explicaba una mayor proporción de la varianza del puntaje total de la PCL-5 en comparación con la CAPS-5.Conclusión: Aunque la PCL-5 es psicométricamente sólida, impresiona presentar dificultad para discriminar los síntomas auto reportados de depresión y ansiedad con los síntomas del TEPT en usuarios expuestos a trauma en servicios de salud mental. En las personas que son tamizadas como positivas con la PCL-5, los clínicos deberían evaluar la totalidad los síntomas para el TEPT con atención. Los clínicos y los investigadores también deberían estar atentos a no asumir que las características operativas de las mediciones auto reportadas para el TEPT son válidas para usuarios de servicios de salud mental cuando estas han sido desarrolladas en otras poblaciones.背景:PTSD自我报告测量在心理健康服务中频繁使用, 但很少在包括平民的临床样本中进行评估。开发了PCL-5以评估DSM-5 PTSD。目的:本研究旨在评估有创伤暴露和PTSD症状的心理健康服务使用者样本中PCL-5的心理测量学特性。方法:在273名报告了过往PTSD诊断或创伤应激症状筛查阳性者的参与者样本中, 考查了PCL-5的可靠性和有效性。诊断效能通过与DSM-5临床用PTSD量表 (CAPS-5) 相比进行评估。结果:PCL-5具有很高的内部一致性, 良好的收敛和发散效度, 可接受的稳定性和良好的诊断效能。但是, 操作特性不同于其他样本中的发现。43-44的得分具有PTSD最佳诊断效能。事后回归分析表明, 相较于CAPS-5, 抑郁解释了更多PCL-5总分的变异。结论:虽然PCL-5从心理测量上讲是可靠的, 但在有创伤暴露的心理健康服务使用者中似乎很难对自我报告的抑郁和焦虑与PTSD进行区分, 当其PCL-5筛查为阳性筛查时, 临床医生应注意评估其全面症状。临床医生和研究人员也应注意不要认为自我报告的PTSD测量特性对精神卫生服务使用者有效, 尽管这些特性已在其他人群中验证。.",31

A poorer trajectory was predicted by female gender, recent life stressors, presence of mild traumatic brain injury and admission to intensive care unit.These findings demonstrate the long-term PTSD effects that can occur following traumatic injury.

We sought to examine measurement invariance of the construct of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders indexed by the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) in a sample of 834 Marines with significant combat experience. PTSD was assessed 1-month predeployment (T0), and again at 1-month (T1), 5-months (T2), and 8-months postdeployment (T3). We tested configural (pattern of item/parcel loadings), metric (item/parcel loadings on latent factors), and scalar (item/parcel-level severity) invariance and explored sources of measurement instability (partial invariance testing). The T0 best-fitting emotional numbing model factor structure informed the conceptualization of PTSD's latent factors and parcel formations. We found (1) scalar noninvariance for the construct of PTSD as measured by the PCL and the CAPS, and for PTSD symptom clusters as assessed by the CAPS; and (2) metric noninvariance for PTSD symptom clusters as measured by the PCL. Exploratory analyses revealed factor-loading and intercept differences from pre- to postdeployment for avoidance symptoms, numbing symptoms (mainly psychogenic amnesia and foreshortened future), and the item assessing startle, each of which reduced construct stability.

The current study aims to investigate the relationship between daily measured PTSD symptoms during an intensive six-day treatment program and overall post-treatment outcomes. The treatment program combines eye movement desensitization with reprocessing and prolonged exposure, as well as physical activity and psychoeducation. It was expected that for the entire duration of treatment, as well as the first half of the treatment, a greater decline in daily PTSD symptoms would be a predictor for a greater decline in PTSD symptoms at a four-week follow-up. Data from 109 PTSD-patients (87.2% female, mean age = 36.9, SD = 11.5) were used. PTSD symptoms were measured with the CAPS-5 and the self-reported PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Daily PTSD symptoms were measured with an abbreviated version of the PCL-5 (8-item PCL). Latent growth curve models were used to describe changes in daily PTSD symptoms and predict treatment outcome. Results show that a greater decline in daily PTSD symptoms measured by the 8-item PCL predicts better treatment outcome (CAPS-5 and PCL-5), but that a patient’s PTSD symptoms on the first day of treatment has no predictive effect. A decline in PTSD symptoms only during the first half of treatment was also found to predict treatment outcomes. Future research should be focused on replicating the results of the current study.",36

The PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5) is a valid, efficient measure of symptom severity, but its completion is time consuming. Subsequently, abbreviated four‐ and eight‐item versions were developed using the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview–7 PTSD module and validated in Veteran samples. This study aimed to validate these abbreviated versions using the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale for DSM‐5 (CAPS‐5), the gold standard for PTSD diagnosis, in a traumatically injured civilian population. Participants were 251 traumatically injured adults ( M age = 42.52 years; 69.3% male; 50.2% Caucasian) recruited from a Level 1 trauma center inpatient unit; 32.3% and 17.9% of participants experienced a motor vehicle crash or gunshot wound, respectively. The CAPS‐5 and PCL‐5 were administered approximately 6.5 months postinjury. We examined whether compared to the full PCL‐5, the abbreviated versions would adequately differentiate between participants with and without a CAPS‐5 PTSD diagnosis. The abbreviated versions were highly correlated with the total scale and showed good‐to‐excellent internal consistency. The diagnostic utility of the abbreviated measures was comparable to that of the total scale regarding sensitivity, suggesting they may be useful as abbreviated screening tools; however, the total scale functioned better regarding specificity. The abbreviated versions of the PCL‐5 may be useful screening instruments in the long‐term care of traumatic injury survivors and may be more likely to be implemented across routine clinical and research contexts.",37

However, its use, particularly in settings involving longitudinal assessment, has been complicated by changes in the diagnostic criteria between the fourth and fifth editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (i.e., DSM‐IV and DSM‐5 , respectively). The current sample included trauma‐exposed U.S. veterans who were deployed in support of military operations following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks ( N = 371) and were enrolled in a longitudinal study focused on deployment‐related stress and traumatic brain injury. A hybrid clinical interview using item wording from the CAPS for DSM‐IV (CAPS‐IV) with the addition of items unique to the CAPS for DSM‐5 ( CAPS‐5 ) was used to assess both DSM‐IV and DSM‐5 PTSD diagnostic criteria, allowing for the calculation of separate total scores and diagnoses. Diagnostic agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and interrater reliability between CAPS‐IV and CAPS‐5 were evaluated for the entire sample and stratified by gender.

Physical aggression was the most traumatic behavior reported by 39.3% of psychiatric professionals. A feeling of insecurity when performing professional tasks was reported by 93.3% of participants. Among participants, 41.9% expressed the desire to change workplace. The mean score on the PCL-5 was 21.6 ± 15.35. Five participants (16.7%) had a PCL-5 score ≥ 38. The Compassion Satisfaction mean score was 37.48 ± 5.64. The burnout mean score was 26.41 ± 7.3 and the mean score at the secondary traumatic stress scale was 27 ±6.7. Conclusions PTSD could result from stressful events encountered in the course of managing patients in mental health departments. Attention to post-traumatic event interventions may be useful both to reduce the rate of PTSD and to improve the professional quality of life among psychiatric staff.",41
https://openalex.org/W2418785032,,A comparison of persons with Posttraumatic stress disorder and the normative sample with the Trauma Symptom Inventory,"IntroductionThe Trauma Symptom Inventory [1] (TSI) consists of 100 items and serves for the evaluation of acute and chronic trauma symptoms which include, but are not limited to, the consequences of rape, spousal abuse, physical assaults, serious accidents and natural disasters, permanent consequences of abuse in childhood as well as other early traumatic experiences. The TSI includes 10 clinical scales and 3 validity scales. The various scales of the TSI assess a wide range of psychological impacts, and five of the ten clinical scales measure symptoms closely related to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [2] (DSM-IV-TR) symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Clinical scales include not only symptoms typically associated with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but also those for the Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), and intra- and interpersonal difficul ties often associated with more chronic psychological trauma.In this research we wanted to evaluate the TSI, based on whether it is a good diagnostic instrument for diagnosing PTSD. The TSI does not generate DSM-V diagnoses; instead, it is intended to evaluate the relative level of various forms of posttraumatic distress. In 2014, the American Psychiatric Association revised the PTSD diagnostic criteria in the fifth edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. [2] Diagnostic criteria for PTSD include a history of exposure to a traumatic event meeting two criteria and symptoms from each of three symptom clusters: intrusive recollections, avoidant/ numbing symptoms, and hyper-arousal symptoms. Fifth criterion concerns duration of symptoms and a sixth assesses functioning. It is estimated that the prevalence of PTSD in general population is between 1 and 7% (depending on the diagnostic criteria), while in Vietnam veterans, firemen, rape victims, and persons who have been exposed to extreme stressful situations, frequency of PTSD is somewhere in between 20 and 40%. [3-7]In validation studies done by Briere, [8] all of the clinical scales were higher in samples of PTSD group, compared to the normative non-PTSD sample. In the research done by McDevitt-Murphy, Weathers and Adkins, [9] PTSD and non-PTSD groups differed on seven TSI clinical scales and one validity scale, with Cohen's d ranging from 0.26 to 0.53. In that research, the largest effect sizes and best diagnostic utility were found on two clinical scales: Defensive Avoidance and Anxious Arousal scale. We wanted to further investigate, whether the same scales are equally important in Croatian PTSD sample. It is confirmed that there is a substantial evidence of the cross-cultural validity of PTSD. [10] However, evidence of cross-cultural variability in certain areas suggests the need for further research. Also we were interested whether the symptoms stated in the DSM-V for PTSD is also valid and do they have similar frequency in Croatian.The aim of this study was to examine whether the scales are related to PTSD symptoms, and which scales would best predict the diagnosis of PTSD.Subjects and MethodsSubjectsIn this research we gathered the data for 235 participants, of which all of them were males (average age: 33 years) from the community. All of the participants gave their written consent for the participation in this research.The clinical sample consisted of 51 males, between 38 and 61 years of age (average age: 48.5 years). The participants were hospitalized based on a diagnosis of PTSD. All of those patients developed PTSD during the war, as they were Croatian soldiers in the Croatian War of Independence (1991 - 1995).All of the participants completed the Croatian version of TSI. [1]MeasurementThe TSI has a total of 100 items and contains 10 clinical scales. In the manual1 for the TSI are stated the reliabilities for the scales: Anxious Arousal (AA; 8 items, alpha = 0,81), Depression (D; 8 items, alpha = 0,79), Anger/Irritability (AI; 9 items, alpha = 0,87), Intrusive Experiences (IE; 8 items, alpha = 0,84), Defensive Avoidance (DA; 8 items, alpha = 0,87), Dissociation (DIS; 9 items, alpha = 0,78), Sexual Concerns (SC; 9 items, alpha = 0,78), Dysfunctional Sexual Behavior (DSB; 9 items, alpha = 0,81), Impaired Self- Reference (ISR; 9 items, alpha = 0,84), and Tension Reduction Behavior (TRB; 8 items, alpha = 0,54). …",42

The PCL was recently revised to reflect DSM‐5 changes to the PTSD criteria. In this article, the authors describe the development and initial psychometric evaluation of the PCL for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5). Psychometric properties of the PCL‐5 were examined in 2 studies involving trauma‐exposed college students. In Study 1 ( N = 278), PCL‐5 scores exhibited strong internal consistency (α = .94), test‐retest reliability ( r = .82), and convergent ( r s = .74 to .85) and discriminant ( r s = .31 to .60) validity. In addition, confirmatory factor analyses indicated adequate fit with the DSM‐5 4‐factor model, χ 2 (164) = 455.83, p &lt; .001, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .07, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) = .08, comparative fit index (CFI) = .86, and Tucker‐Lewis index (TLI) = .84, and superior fit with recently proposed 6‐factor, χ 2 (164) = 318.37, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .05, RMSEA = .06, CFI = .92, and TLI = .90, and 7‐factor, χ 2 (164) = 291.32, p &lt; .001, SRMR = .05, RMSEA = .06, CFI = .93, and TLI = .91, models. In Study 2 ( N = 558), PCL‐5 scores demonstrated similarly strong reliability and validity. Overall, results indicate that the PCL‐5 is a psychometrically sound measure of PTSD symptoms. Implications for use of the PCL‐5 in a variety of assessment contexts are discussed.",43

However, the validity of these studies depends on the establishment of measurement invariance of the construct(s) of interest. The current study examined the stability of the most optimal PTSD Model symptom cluster constructs (assessed by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 [PCL-5]) across subgroups experiencing one versus multiple TE types. The sample included university students (n = 556) endorsing at least one TE (Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire). Using data from the entire sample, results suggest that the PCL-5-assessed Hybrid Model provided a significantly better fit compared to other models. Results also indicated invariance of factor loadings (metric), and intercepts (scalar) for the PCL-5-assessed Hybrid Model factors across subgroups endorsing one (n = 191) versus multiple TE types (n = 365). Our findings thus support the stability, applicability, and meaningful comparison of the PCL-assessed Hybrid Model factor structure (including subscale severity scores) across subgroups experiencing one versus multiple TE types.",44

Post-stroke PTSD is attracting increasing attention, but there was no study assessing the psychometric properties of the PCL-5 in stroke populations. Our study was conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in Chinese stroke patients. Methods This was a cross-sectional observational study conducted at our hospital. Three hundred and forty-eight Chinese stroke patients came to our hospital for outpatient service were recruited. They were instructed to complete the PCL-5 scales and were interviewed for PTSD diagnosis with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). The cutoff scores, reliability and validity of the PCL-5 were analyzed. Results PCL-5 scores in our sample were positively skewed, suggesting low levels of PTSD symptoms. The reliability of PCL-5 was good. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated acceptable construct validity, and confirmed the multi-dimensionality of the PCL-5. By CFA analysis, the seven-factor hybrid model demonstrated the best model fit. The PCL-5 also showed good convergent validity and discriminant validity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed a PCL-5 score of 37 achieved optimal sensitivity and specificity for detecting PTSD. Conclusions Our findings supported the use of PCL-5 as a psychometrically adequate measure of post-stroke PTSD in the Chinese patients.",45

The purpose of this study was to identify whether PTSD diagnosis and PTSD symptom scale score (PTSD severity) could be predicted by assessing peritraumatic experiences using a single question or screening tools at different time points in patients hospitalized after admission to the hospital after significant physical trauma, but with stable vitals (level II trauma).Patients completed the 'initial question' and the National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Scale (NSESSS) at 3 days to 5 days after trauma (NSESSS-1). The same scale was administered 2 weeks to 4 weeks after trauma (NSESSS-2). The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Scale Interview for DSM-5 (PSSI-5) was administered 2 months after trauma. PTSD diagnosis and PTSD severity were extracted from the PSSI-5. Linear multivariate regression analyses were used to establish whether scores for NSESSS-1 or NSESSS-2 predicted PTSD diagnosis/PTSD severity. Non-linear multivariate regression analyses were performed to better understand the relationship between NSESSS-1/NSESSS-2 and PTSD diagnosis/PTSD severity.A single question assessing the experience of fear, helplessness, or horror was not an effective tool for determining the diagnosis of PTSD (p=0.114) but can be a predictor of PTSD severity (p=0.039). We demonstrate that administering the NSESSS after either 3 days to 5 days (p=0.008, p<0.001) or 2 weeks to 4 weeks (p=0.039; p<0.001) can predict the diagnosis of PTSD and PTSD severity. Scoring an NSESSS above 14/28 (50%) increases the chance of experiencing a higher PTSD severity substantially and linearly.Our initial question was not an effective predictor of PTSD diagnosis. However, using the NSESSS at both 3 days to 5 days and 2 weeks to 4 weeks after trauma is an effective method for predicting PTSD diagnosis and PTSD severity. Additionally, we show that patients who score higher than 14 on the NSESSS for acute stress symptoms may need closer follow-up.Level III, prognostic.",46

What could be the reason as by its name and diagnostic criteria an etiological fact is specified, namely a specific traumatic event. In our paper we aim to share and elicit some difficulties that we have met in consulting, diagnostic and management of people, who have suffered a traumatic event. On the base of a review of current psychiatric classifications and ongoing discussions we briefly summarize and discuss important key points. The definition of the event, associated with PTSD is different in DSM-III (introduced for the fist time in a classification of mental disorders), DSM-IV and ICD-10. DSMIV is less restrictive and includes events that occur more frequently. In DSM-5, PTSD is placed in chapter “Trauma and Stressor-related disorders” and the accent is on the variable clinical characteristics of psychological distress. Emotional reactions to the traumatic event are no longer part of Criterion A. The clinical presentation varies and a number of intrusive psychological and physiological reactions of distress are described. Here comes a problem- the assessment of the trauma itself and the determination of the basic symptoms, when such an event happens. So, the skills to assess the trauma, to determine and competently attribute these symptoms to the specific event and cluster are of great importance. We conclude that a number of risk and prognostic factors should be considered in the process of assessment, diagnosis and management.",47
https://openalex.org/W3102922645,10.1017/sjp.2020.46,Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) to Examine the Internal Structure of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms,"Abstract Several studies have reported the factor structure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results show models with different number of factors, high correlations between factors, and symptoms that belong to different factors in different models without affecting the fit index. These elements could suppose the existence of considerable item cross-loading, the overlap of different factors or even the presence of a general factor that explains the items common source of variance. The aim is to provide new evidence regarding the factor structure of PTSD using CFA and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). In a sample of 1,372 undergraduate students, we tested six different models using CFA and two models using ESEM and ESEM bifactor analysis. Trauma event and past-month PTSD symptoms were assessed with Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC–5) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL–5). All six tested CFA models showed good fit indexes (RMSEA = .051–.056, CFI = .969–.977, TLI = .965–.970), with high correlations between factors ( M = .77, SD = .09 to M = .80, SD = .09). The ESEM models showed good fit indexes (RMSEA = .027–.036, CFI = .991–.996, TLI = .985–.992). These models confirmed the presence of cross-loadings on several items as well as loads on a general factor that explained 76.3% of the common variance. The results showed that most of the items do not meet the assumption of dimensional exclusivity, showing the need to expand the analysis strategies to study the symptomatic organization of PTSD.",48

The study aimed to investigate the dimensions of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 5 according to the DSM-5's broader definition of PTSD and the ICD-11's narrower approach, as well as to explore an alternative restricted model that retains the core symptoms explicitly related to traumatic experiences.Data were gathered from [edited out for blind review] employees (N = 1,101) who directly experienced life traumatic events or were exposed to them because of their work activities. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) were used to evaluate the configural and metric structures of the models.We estimated seven models of the latent structure of PTSD including the four-factor DSM-5 and three-factors ICD-11 PTSD models. Given the lack of validity evidence for them, an alternative 10-symptom model was tested. The final 7-item PTSD model considerably improved estimation of the PTSD construct. This solution showed reliable items with non-redundant content, acceptable fit indices and satisfactory configural and metric properties.The more parsimonious one-dimensional model comprising the PTSD core symptoms has the potential do improve the assessment of PTSD.",49

Both scales purportedly assess PTSD severity with the same number of items, scaling, and scoring range, but differences in scores between measures make outcomes difficult to decipher.Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine several possible psychometric reasons for the discrepancy in scores between interview and self-report.Method: Data were combined from four clinical trials to examine the baseline and posttreatment assessments of treatment-seeking active duty military personnel and veterans.Results: As in previous studies, total scores were higher on the PCL-5 compared to the CAPS-5 at baseline and posttreatment. At baseline, PCL-5 scores were higher on all 20 items, with small to large differences in effect size. At posttreatment, only three items were not significantly different. Distributions of item responses and wording of scale anchors and items were examined as possible explanations of the difference between measures. Participants were more likely to use the full range of responses on the PCL-5 compared to interviewers.Conclusions: Suggestions for improving the congruence between these two scales are discussed. Administration of interviews by trained assessors can be resource intensive, so it is important that those assessing PTSD severity are afforded confidence in the equivalence of their assessment of PTSD regardless of the assessment method used.",50

We aimed to study the predominant distress causing cluster and individual symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) at the clinical and subthreshold level in patients with traumatic injuries, based on the mechanism of injury (MOI). Methods A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted at a Level 1 Trauma Center utilizing PTSD Checklist to diagnose PTSD after one month of the traumatic event. All patients suffering from psychological distresses were assessed by a clinical psychologist in the trauma section. PTSD diagnostic criteria from DSM-5 were used to classify the patients. The inclusion criteria comprised of adult trauma patients who were directly involved in traumatic injuries and admitted under the Trauma Surgery services for a minimum of one day; have ability to provide written informed consent and can be assessed with the PCL-5 checklist after 4 weeks post-injury. Results Two hundred patients completed PCL-5 checklist, of them 26 (13.0%) were positive for PTSD and 174 (87%) had subthreshold scores. The mean age of participants was 34.4±11.8 years and males constituted 90.5%. Road traffic injury (RTI) was most the frequent injury mechanism (59%). PTSD positive patients with RTI, fall of heavy objects, pedestrian injury and assaults had highest average scores on clusters of negative alterations in mood and cognitions (16.9, 18.0, 18.5, 17.0 respectively), followed by hyperarousal. Symptom of always being on the guard and having repeated unwanted or disturbing memories of the incident, was reported by nearly 100% PTSD positive patients. Patients with subthreshold scores also reported distressing symptoms on all four clusters of PTSD. Conclusions Patients with different MOI showed a broad range of psychological problems with respect to symptom clusters. Negative alteration in mood and cognition followed by hyperarousal caused higher level of distress in patients post traumatic injuries. Subthreshold symptoms of PTSD are more common and deserve more attention.",51

Based on longitudinal studies, different hypotheses have been proposed to explain PTSD symptom dynamics. But currently, no study have been conducted to test these hypotheses in children and adolescents. Data were derived from a longitudinal study of child and adolescent traumatic event survivors of an explosion accident (N = 659). DSM-5 PTSD symptoms was measured by the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) at 4, 8, and 13 months after the disaster. Latent difference score (LDS) modeling was used to evaluate the dynamic interplay between clusters. The results of LDS model indicated that intrusion level positively predicted subsequent rate of increase for hyperarousal (p = .008) and negative changes in cognitions and mood symptoms (p = .036). Also, intrusion level trended to positively predict subsequent increase rate of avoidance symptoms (p = .059). This study expands previous knowledge of dynamic relations between symptom clusters during the maintenance and fluctuation of child and adolescent PTSD symptoms. By using new methodology, this study provided novel evidence for the hypothesis that intrusion symptom plays an important role in maintaining other PTSD symptoms.",52

As PTSD is underdiagnosed, this study explored the value of self-reported physical symptoms in screening for 30-day PTSD in military personnel. Two physical symptom scales were constructed using items from a 67-item health symptom checklist, clinical interviews were used as the diagnostic reference standard, and diagnostic utility of physical symptoms was compared with the current gold standard screen, the PTSD checklist (PCL). Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed that both a 9-item and a 10-item physical symptom scale were of value in predicting PTSD (areas under the curve 0.81 and 0.85). Importantly, two thirds of PTSD positive personnel missed by the PCL were captured with physical symptoms scales, and when physical symptoms were added to the PCL, prediction was improved (areas under the curve 0.90 to 0.92). Our findings highlight the value of including assessing physical symptoms in PTSD screening.",53

Participants completed a demographic survey, PHQ-9 (depressive symptoms), the Life Stressor Checklist (stressful events) and the PCL-C (PTSD symptoms in civilian populations). We calculated descriptive statistics and chi-square solutions for participant demographics. Classes of trauma history were established using latent class analysis (LCA). Latent indicators were extracted from participant self-reported traumatic histories on the LSC-R. Traumatic events have been found to be predictive of both depression. Latent class solution selection was guided by utility in evaluating and discriminating between classes as predictors of scales measuring depression or trauma exposure. Three distinct classes of trauma histories were identified: a high trauma (HT) class, an abuse/neglect (AN) class and a childhood trauma (CT) class. Binary logistic regression analyses determined whether trauma profiles predicted depression or PTSD after controlling for age, marital status, race and education. Participants in both the AN and CT class were over five times more likely than those in the HT class to endorse depressive symptoms. Classes differed significantly on whether they endorse depressive symptoms (p = .008) and marital status (p = .009), while PTSD appeared to trend toward significance (p = .085).",54

However, the DSM-5 does not specify the number or type of symptoms needed to assign them. The purpose of the current study was to extend our understanding of subthreshold PTSD by comparing four commonly used definitions adapted to the DSM-5 PTSD criteria in an outpatient treatment-seeking sample. Veterans (N = 193) presenting to PTSD clinics were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Participants reported a criterion A traumatic event, but did not meet criteria for threshold-PTSD. We hypothesized that the number of veterans captured would be highest when fewer specific criterion sets were required by the subthreshold definition. Our hypothesis was upheld in that the more criteria required by the subthreshold PTSD definition, the lower the number of veterans counted within the group. The study consisted primarily of trauma treatment-seeking male veterans, with chronic PTSD symptoms. In addition, the sample size was small and was collected as part of routine clinical care. These results support previous contentions around careful decision making when defining what constitutes subthreshold PTSD in research and clinical work. It also points to the need for continued research to better understand the diagnostic and treatment implications of subthreshold PTSD.",55

We conducted an LCA on the basis of symptoms of PTSD and dissociation as assessed by the CAPS-5. Moreover, severity of PTSD (PCL-5), difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS), and depressive symptoms (BDI-II) were compared between patients with D-PTSD according to the CAPS-5 interview and patients without dissociative symptoms.LCA results suggested a 5-class model with one subgroup showing the highest probability to fulfill criteria for the dissociative subtype and high scores on both BDI and DERS. Significantly higher scores on the DERS, BDI and PCL-5 were found in the D-PTSD group diagnosed with the CAPS-5 (n = 75; 35.7%). Sexual trauma was also reported more often by this subgroup. When comparing the dissociative subtype to the LCA results, only a partial overlap could be found.Our findings suggest that patients with D-PTSD have significantly more problems with emotion regulation, more depressive symptoms, and more severe PTSD-symptoms. Given the results of our LCA, we conclude that the dissociative subtype seems to be more complex than D-PTSD as diagnosed by means of the CAPS-5.Antecedentes: Un subtipo disociativo del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT-D) fue introducido en la 5ª edición del Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de los Trastornos Mentales (DSM-5), pero los perfiles latentes y los correlatos clínicos del TEPT-D siguen siendo controversiales. Objetivo Los objetivos de nuestro estudio fueron identificar subgrupos de individuos con distintos patrones de síntomas de TEPT, incluyendo síntomas disociativos, mediante análisis de clases latentes (LCA, por sus siglas en inglés), comparar estos resultados con la categorización de TEPT-D vs. TEPT sin rasgos disociativos según la entrevista CAPS-5, y explorar si el TEPT-D se asocia con una mayor gravedad del TEPT, dificultades en la regulación de las emociones y síntomas depresivos.Método: Se investigó una muestra alemana de individuos que buscaban tratamiento (N = 352). Se realizó un LCA sobre la base de los síntomas de TEPT y disociación evaluados por el CAPS-5. Además, se comparó la gravedad del TEPT (PCL-5), las dificultades en la regulación de las emociones (DERS) y los síntomas depresivos (BDI-II) entre los pacientes con TEPT según la entrevista CAPS-5 y los pacientes sin síntomas disociativos.Resultados: Los resultados del LCA sugirieron un modelo de 5 clases con un subgrupo que mostraba la mayor probabilidad de cumplir los criterios del subtipo disociativo y altas puntuaciones tanto en el BDI como en el DERS. Se encontraron puntuaciones significativamente más altas en el DERS, el BDI y el PCL-5 en el grupo de TEPT-D diagnosticado con el CAPS-5 (n = 75; 35,7%). Este subgrupo también informó con más frecuencia de traumas sexuales. Al comparar el subtipo disociativo con los resultados del LCA, sólo se pudo encontrar una superposición parcial. Conclusiones Nuestros resultados sugieren que los pacientes con TEPT-D tienen significativamente más problemas con la regulación emocional, más síntomas depresivos y síntomas de TEPT más graves.

To advance the understanding of the role of specific PTSD symptoms in the development of suicidality, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the predictive effects of the three specific PTSD symptom clusters on suicidal ideation prospectively. Fifty-six individuals diagnosed with PTSD completed a two-stage research design, at baseline and 13–15 months follow-up. The clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS) was used to assess the severity of the PTSD symptom clusters and validated self-report measures were used to assess suicidal ideation, severity of depressive symptoms and perceptions of defeat entrapment. The results showed that only the hyperarousal symptom cluster significantly predicted suicidal ideation at follow-up after controlling for baseline suicidal ideation, severity of depressive symptoms and perceptions of defeat and entrapment. These findings suggest that both disorder-specific and transdiagnostic factors are implicated in the development of suicidal ideation in PTSD. Important clinical implications are discussed in terms of predicting and treating suicidality in those with PTSD.",58

We explored whether self-reported indices of hyperarousal predict longitudinally measured objective, subjective, and retrospective evaluations of sleep quality in trauma-exposed individuals. Methods Individuals exposed to a DSM-5 PTSD Criterion-A traumatic event within the past two years (N=130, 91 females), aged 18-40 (mean 24.43, SD 5.30), 51.54% of whom met DSM-5 criteria for PTSD, completed 14 days of actigraphy and sleep diaries. Participants also completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), published Hyperarousal (HAS) and Hypervigilance (HVQ) scales, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (N=108-125 for different scales). Mean total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency (SE) and sleep midpoint were calculated from actigraphy and subjective SOL, SE, number of awakenings, and time spent awake from diaries. Simple regressions were used to predict associations of the PCL-5, HAS, and HVQ scores with measures of sleep quality. Results Hyperarousal indices predicted diary but not actigraphy measures of sleep quality. Longer diary-reported SOL was predicted by higher scores for: PCL-5 total score (R=0.290, p=0.001), PCL-5 hyperarousal items without the sleep item (R=0.261, p=0.004), and HAS without sleep items (R=0.220, p=0.016). Diary-reported number of awakenings and wake time after sleep onset were predicted by higher HAS scores without the sleep question: (R=0.373, p&amp;lt;0.001; r=0.352, p&amp;lt;0.001). Similarly, all hyperarousal indices significantly predicted PSQI global score (PCL-5: R=0.482, p&amp;lt;0.001; PCL-5 hyperarousal: R=0.389, p&amp;lt;0.001; HVQ: R=0.214, p=0.017; HAS without sleep question: R=0.415, p&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusion Self-reported hyperarousal measures predict subjective longitudinal (especially SOL) and retrospective measures, but not objective measurements of sleep quality. Similar discrepancies between self-reported and objective measures of sleep quality have been reported in patients with insomnia disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia may be especially effective in treating post-traumatic sleep disturbances. Support R01MH109638",59
https://openalex.org/W3202235799,10.1037/tra0001146,Exploring the factor structure of the PTSD checklist for DSM–5 in psychotic disorders.,"The PTSD Checklist for DSM (PCL) is the most widely used screener to assess posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in those with psychotic disorders (psychosis), though previous research has questioned its validity in psychosis. Considerable symptom overlap between the 2 disorders (e.g., concentration difficulties, avoidance, etc.) along with the general underdiagnosing of PTSD in psychosis speaks to the need for consensus regarding brief screeners. This hypothesis-generating study is the first to explore the PCL-5 (its most recent iteration) factor structure in psychosis to assess if a more valid underlying structure may exist.Sixty-5 individuals who met the DSM-5 PTSD criterion A traumatic event following an interview subsequently completed the PCL-5. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to explore the latent structure of the PCL-5 in psychotic disorders.A 4-factor solution differing from the DSM-5 4-factor model emerged as the best fitting model. Resulting PCL-5 dimensions in psychosis were identified as (1) Reexperiencing/Negative Affect; (2) Depressive; (3) Externalizing Anxious Behaviors; and (4) Avoidance/Physiological Reactivity.Results guide the hypothesis that the latent structure of the PCL-5 may be unique in psychosis, which will have important clinical implications. Research is now needed to confirm the proposed model in larger samples of individuals with psychosis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",60

The primary outcomes, clinician-rated severity of PTSD symptoms, and diagnostic status (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale; CAPS-IV) were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and at three and six months. Treatment response trajectories were identified and predictors of these trajectories explored.Results: Mixed model repeated measures analysis of CAPS-IV scores showed a baseline-to-posttreatment decrease in PTSD symptom severity (p < .001) that persisted during the three- and six-month follow-ups with large effect sizes (Cohen’s d > 1.2); 71% of the participants responded. None of the participants dropped out during the intensive phase and only 5% during the booster phase. Adverse events were extremely low and only a minority showed symptom exacerbation. Cluster analysis demonstrated four treatment response trajectories: Fast responders (13%), Slow responders (26%), Partial responders (32%), and Non-responders (29%). Living condition and between-session fear habituation were found to predict outcome. Participants living alone were more likely to belong to the Partial responders than to the Non-responders cluster, and participants showing more between-session fear habituation were more likely to belong to the Fast responders than to the Non-responders cluster.Conclusions: The results of this open study suggest that iPE can be effective in PTSD patients with multiple interpersonal trauma and after multiple previous treatment attempts. In addition, in this chronic PTSD population iPE was safe.",61

Participants completed the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) at admission and discharge.Over half of patients scored above the cutoff of 33 on the PCL-5 at admission, suggestive of PTSD symptoms characteristic of a formal PTSD diagnosis. The average PCL-5 score significantly decreased for every ED diagnostic category, and there was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients above the PCL-5 cutoff score at discharge. PCL-5 subscales measuring PTSD criteria B (intrusions) and C (avoidance) improved with modest effect sizes, whereas PCL-5 subscales D (negative alterations in cognitions and mood) and E (alterations in arousal and reactivity) improved with larger effect sizes.PTSD symptoms are prevalent among patients with EDs seeking higher levels of care. Despite not offering evidence-based trauma-specific interventions, PTSD symptoms decreased over the course of treatment. However, improvements cannot definitely be attributed to trauma-informed care.",62

The aim of the current study was to examine the degree to which newly established PTSD symptom clusters differentially relate to co-occurring psychopathology and related clinical phenomena through Wald testing using latent variable modeling. Participants were 535 trauma-exposed undergraduates who completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) and Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991). As expected and in line with results from previous studies, significant heterogeneity emerged for dysphoric arousal, anxious arousal, and externalizing behavior. However, there was less evidence for the distinctiveness of negative affect and anhedonia. Results indicate that only some of the newly established symptom clusters significantly differ in their associations with related clinical phenomena and that the hybrid model might not provide a meaningful framework for understanding which PTSD symptoms relate to associated features. Limitations include a non-clinical sample and reliance on retrospective self-report assessment measures.",63

This study also aimed to contribute with empirical data to clarify the best latent structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Specifically, the DSM-5 four-factor model and other competing models for PTSD symptoms (four-factor Dysphoria model, five-factor Dysphoric Arousal model, six-factor Anhedonia model, six-factor Externalizing Behavior model, and seven-factor Hybrid model) applied to PCL-5 were analyzed and compared in this paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",64

Aims To investigate the latent structure of the proposed ICD-11 PTSD symptoms. Method Confirmatory factor analyses using data from structured clinical interviews administered to injury patients ( n = 613) 6 years post-trauma. Measures of disability and psychological quality of life (QoL) were also administered. Results Although the three-factor model implied by the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria fit the data well, a two-factor model provided equivalent, if not superior, fit. Whereas diagnostic criteria based on this two-factor model resulted in an increase in PTSD point prevalence (5.1% v. 3.4%; z = 2.32, P &lt;0.05), they identified individuals with similar levels of disability ( P = 0.933) and QoL ( P = 0.591) to those identified by the ICD-11 criteria. Conclusions Consistent with theorised reciprocal relationships between re-experiencing and avoidance in PTSD, these findings support an alternative diagnostic algorithm requiring at least two of any of the four re-experiencing/avoidance symptoms and at least one of the two hyperarousal symptoms.",65

Recently, the debate has focused on consequences of having two different descriptions of PTSD: 20 symptoms belonging to four symptom clusters in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5), and three symptoms clusters in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) most often operationalized by six symptoms in the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) (2017) and Hansen, Hyland, Armour, Shevlin, & Elklit (2015). Research has provided support for both models of PTSD, but at the same time indicates differences in estimated prevalence rates of PTSD (Hansen et al., 2015, 2017). A growing body of research has modelled PTSD both theoretically and statistically as a network of interacting symptoms (Birkeland, Greene, & Spiller, 2020), yet it remains more unclear how the two diagnostic systems perform regarding which symptoms are more central/interconnected.Objectives and methods: We estimated two 23-item Gaussian Graphical Models to investigate whether ICD-11 or DSM-5 PTSD symptoms are more central in two trauma-exposed samples: a community sample (N = 2,367) and a military veteran sample (N = 657). PTSD DSM-5 was measured with the PTSD checklist-5 (PCL-5) and the PTSD ICD-11 was measure by the ITQ PTSD subscale.Results: Five of the six most central symptoms estimated via the expected influence centrality metric across the two samples were identical and represented symptoms from both diagnostic systems operationalized by the PCL-5 and the ITQ.Conclusions: The results of the present study underline that symptoms from both diagnostic systems hold central positions. The implications of the results are discussed from the perspectives of an indexical (i.e. the diagnostic systems reflect both shared and different aspects of PTSD) and a constitutive view (i.e., the diagnostic systems represent different disorders and the results cannot be reconciled per se) of mental health diagnoses (Kendler, 2017).",66
https://openalex.org/W2135037239,10.1002/da.22364,APPROXIMATING A DSM-5 DIAGNOSIS OF PTSD USING DSM-IV CRITERIA,"Background Diagnostic criteria for DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are in many ways similar to DSM-IV criteria, raising the possibility that it might be possible to closely approximate DSM-5 diagnoses using DSM-IV symptoms. If so, the resulting transformation rules could be used to pool research data based on the two criteria sets. Methods The pre–post deployment study (PPDS) of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) administered a blended 30-day DSM-IV and DSM-5 PTSD symptom assessment based on the civilian PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV (PCL-C) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). This assessment was completed by 9,193 soldiers from three US Army Brigade Combat Teams approximately 3 months after returning from Afghanistan. PCL-C items were used to operationalize conservative and broad approximations of DSM-5 PTSD diagnoses. The operating characteristics of these approximations were examined compared to diagnoses based on actual DSM-5 criteria. Results The estimated 30-day prevalence of DSM-5 PTSD based on conservative (4.3%) and broad (4.7%) approximations of DSM-5 criteria using DSM-IV symptom assessments were similar to estimates based on actual DSM-5 criteria (4.6%). Both approximations had excellent sensitivity (92.6–95.5%), specificity (99.6–99.9%), total classification accuracy (99.4–99.6%), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.96–0.98). Conclusions DSM-IV symptoms can be used to approximate DSM-5 diagnoses of PTSD among recently deployed soldiers, making it possible to recode symptom-level data from earlier DSM-IV studies to draw inferences about DSM-5 PTSD. However, replication is needed in broader trauma-exposed samples to evaluate the external validity of this finding.",67

Methods and analysis This study is a non-interventional, multitrait–multimethod design, multicentre study that will be carried out at German civil and military inpatient and outpatient clinics. A total sample size of n=219 participants who have experienced at least one traumatic event according to criteria as defined in the DSM-5 will be recruited. For the investigation of the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of the CAPS-5, participants will be categorised into one of three groups, depending on their traumatic experiences and post-traumatic symptomatology: (1) monotraumatisation with PTSD; (2) multiple traumatisation with PTSD and (3) traumatisation without PTSD. Interviews will be conducted face to face by interviewers in routine clinical settings. All participants will also be asked to complete a comprehensive set of questionnaires in order to investigate different facets of construct validity and clinical utility. First, differences between all three groups in CAPS-5 sum and subscale scores will be investigated. Test–retest reliability and inter-rater reliability will be determined. Internal consistency will be calculated using structural equation modeling (SEM) based internal consistency coefficients. Construct validity will be measured with Spearman’s rank correlation analyses and multivariate analyses of variance with Holm-Bonferroni corrected post hoc analysis of variances. In order to test diagnostic accuracy, receiver operating characteristics and sensitivity and specificity analyses will be conducted.

Approximately 30 days post-injury, patients completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8).Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curves for the PDI suggested a cutoff score of 17.5 predicting PTSD (Sensitivity = 70%; Specificity = 62%) and depression (Sensitivity = 74%; Specificity = 64%). For the ITSS, ROC curves suggested a cutoff score of 1.5 to predict PTSD (Sensitivity = 72%; Specificity = 60%) and depression (Sensitivity = 67%; Specificity = 62%). Inclusion of both instruments in regression analyses accounted for 2.4%-6.8% greater variance than 1 measure alone in predicting PCL-5 and PHQ-8 scores.The ITSS and PDI each demonstrated significant clinical utility in practice. Use of both measures, versus either alone, likely does not produce sufficient added clinical benefit.

Objective: We aimed to validate the DSPS in two samples of civilian trauma-exposed German-speaking participants.Methods: In Study 1, a pre-registered online study, participants with and without PTSD symptoms (N=558) answered questionnaires about traumatic experiences, dissociation, PTSD, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, alcohol use disorder, absorption, and dissociative responding to trauma-related questionnaires. In Study 2, which used secondary data of a pre-registered clinical study, participants with a PTSD diagnosis (N=71) answered questionnaires about traumatic experiences, dissociation, PTSD, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and dissociative responding to standardized trauma exposure. Moreover, PTSD, D-PTSD, and other diagnoses were assessed with structured clinical interviews. Results: Analyses confirmed a three-factor structure as well as high internal consistency, and high convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity of the DSPS.

Familial and interpersonal relationships are consistently found to be associated with an individual's psychological recovery following a traumatic event. Thus, it is important to understand the extent to which close others' collateral reports converge with clinician and self-reports of PTSD. This study compared self-, collateral, and clinician reports of PTSD symptom severity. Recently trauma-exposed individuals (N = 117) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995) and completed the past-month PTSD Checklist-Specific Stressor (PCL; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993). Close others (N = 117) completed the PCL for close others (PCL-CO; Monson, 2012) that assessed their perceptions of the trauma-exposed individual's PTSD symptoms. There were significant positive correlations among PCL, PCL-CO, and CAPS total and symptom cluster scores (rs = .36-.80). Correlations were significantly stronger between clinician and self-report ratings than self-report and collateral ratings. The weakest correlations were between the PCL and PCL-CO assessing hyperarousal symptoms, r = .36, p < .01, and CAPS and PCL-CO assessing intrusive symptoms, r = .37, p < .01. Self-report measures may provide reliable PTSD assessment when clinician semistructured assessment is unfeasible. Convergence between close others' collateral and clinician and collateral and self-assessment was comparatively weak. Hyperarousal and intrusive symptoms may be more difficult for collaterals to observe and report. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",72

We investigated the psychometric properties of PCL-5 scores in a large cohort (N = 912) of military service members seeking PTSD treatment while stationed in garrison. We examined the internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, and DSM-5 factor structure of PCL-5 scores, their sensitivity to clinical change relative to PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview (PSS-I; Foa, Riggs, Dancu, & Rothbaum, 1993) scores, and their diagnostic utility for predicting a PTSD diagnosis based on various measures and scoring rules. PCL-5 scores exhibited high internal consistency. There was strong agreement between the order of hypothesized and observed correlations among PCL-5 and criterion measure scores. The best-fitting structural model was a 7-factor hybrid model (Armour et al., 2015), which demonstrated closer fit than all other models evaluated, including the DSM-5 model. The PCL-5's sensitivity to clinical change, pre- to posttreatment, was comparable with that of the PSS-I. Optimally efficient cut scores for predicting PTSD diagnosis were consistent with prior research with service members (Hoge, Riviere, Wilk, Herrell, & Weathers, 2014). The results indicate that the PCL-5 is a psychometrically sound measure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms that is useful for identifying provisional PTSD diagnostic status, quantifying PTSD symptom severity, and detecting clinical change over time in PTSD symptoms among service members seeking treatment.

We aimed to test the new ICD‐11 symptom structure for PTSD and CPTSD in a sample of individuals who have experienced homelessness. Experiences of trauma exposure and the associated mental health outcomes have been underresearched in this population. A sample of adults experiencing homelessness ( N = 206) completed structured and semi‐structured interviews that collected information about trauma exposure and symptoms of PTSD and CPTSD. We conducted a latent class analysis (LCA) using six symptom clusters (three PTSD symptom clusters that are components of CPTSD and three CPTSD symptom clusters). All participants reported trauma exposure, with 88.6% having experienced at least one event before 16 years of age. Four distinct classes of participants emerged in relation to the potential to meet the diagnosis: LCA CPTSD ( n = 122, 59.8%), LCA no diagnosis ( n = 27: 13.2%), LCA PTSD ( n = 33; 16.2%), and LCA disturbance in self‐organization (DSO; n = 22; 10.8%). Of note, participants with an ICD‐11 CPTSD as well as those with an ICD‐11 PTSD diagnosis fell into the LCA CPTSD class. Our findings provide some support for the distinction between CPTSD and PTSD within this population specifically but potentially have broader implications. Clear diagnoses will allow targeted PTSD and CPTSD treatment development.",76

The PCL-5 and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5-Research Version (SCID-RV) module for PTSD were administered to 688 patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at two HIV care clinics in the greater Cape Town (South Africa) area. In total, nearly half of the sample (n = 324, 47.1%) reported experiencing an index traumatic event, and 101 participants (14.74%, 95% CI [12.17%, 17.62%]) met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD as measured using the SCID-RV. An ROC curve analysis suggested that a PCL-5 cutoff score of 32 yielded optimal sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.88), indicating that the measure was successful in determining caseness for PTSD 88% of the time and noncaseness 88% of the time. The AUC was 94.3%, 95% CI [92.6% to 96.1%], indicating high accuracy. The positive predictive value and negative predictive values were 56.3% and 97.7%, respectively, which suggests that the PCL-5 is an effective screening instrument to determine the presence of PTSD among South African ART users. Undetected and, thus, untreated PTSD may reduce quality of life, impede optimal adherence to ART, and increase the likelihood of risk behaviors among individuals living with HIV, contributing to further infections. The PCL-5 may be used for detection, referral, and treatment of PTSD as a way to enhance its management among individuals receiving HIV care.",77

Recent studies have suggested more heterogeneous mental health outcomes than the initially identified four adjustment trajectories. To explore this heterogeneity, we investigated the after-trauma adjustment patterns of psychopathology based on retrospective lifetime data. This was first carried out on the PTSD symptoms (PTSS, including no symptoms, few symptoms, partial and full PTSD), and secondly together with their post-trauma comorbidities. Data of trauma and the post-trauma mental disorders were collected for a large and randomly selected community sample, resulting in a N = 960 trauma-exposed subsample. Pattern recognition as carried out by latent class analysis (LCA) was implemented on this subsample. LCA was first exploited to identify the potential trajectory patterns of PTSS and next to explore the patterns of mental adjustments when additional post-trauma comorbid disorders, such as anxiety, mood and substance use disorders, were assessed. Four PTSS trajectory patterns were found, namely resilient, chronic, recovered, and delayed onset, consistent with findings from longitudinal PTSD studies. When post-trauma comorbidities were evaluated, other than the trajectory pattern of delayed onset which retained a low comorbidity profile, the other three split respectively and paired up with either low, moderate or high comorbidity profile. Mental health outcomes after trauma exposure were considerably more complex than the four previously established adjustment trajectories. Here, we uncovered additional and more heterogeneous adjustment patterns comprised of PTSS trajectories and post-trauma comorbidity profiles.",78

Relative to other types of trauma, victims of IPT report greater trauma-specific rumination, whereby they focus on negative consequences of the trauma on their life. Theoretical and empirical work suggest trauma-specific rumination leads to elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS); however, there has been a dearth of research examining how trauma type may impact this association. Therefore, the current longitudinal study examined how the experience of IPT moderates the relationship between trauma-specific rumination and later PTSS.Participants (N = 204) enrolled in a clinical trial completed self-report measures of trauma experience, trauma-specific rumination, and PTSS at baseline and 1-month follow-up appointments.Results revealed that IPT moderated the relationship between baseline rumination and 1-month trauma symptoms, even after covarying for participant age and sex, treatment condition, negative affect, and number of previously experienced traumas. Further, this moderation effect was specific to the PTSD numbing cluster.Major limitations include measurement of PTSS via PCL-C rather than the PCL-5, as well as a limited sample size, precluding moderation analyses of other trauma types.The current study provides novel findings demonstrating specificity of index trauma type in the longitudinal relationship between rumination and PTSS. Future work is needed to examine how IPT impacts the development of pathways between rumination and PTSS.",79

Method The sample included 183 clients who reported exposure to traumatic events and significant PTS (PCL‐5 ≥ 33). Participants ( M age = 37.8, 53.6% female) completed surveys at intake, 3 months, and 6 months into treatment. A cross‐lagged panel analysis was used to test the relationships among perceived social engagement, coping self‐efficacy, and PTS across three assessment points. Results PTS at 3‐months was a mediator in the relationship between intake perceived social engagement and 6‐month coping self‐efficacy and between intake perceived social engagement and 6‐month perceived social engagement. Conclusions PTS several months into treatment may serve as a mechanism between intake perceived social engagement and functional outcomes such as coping self‐efficacy.",80

A subsample of these participants (n = 140) was used to define a valid diagnostic cutoff score for the instrument using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers, Blake, et al., 2013) as the reference standard. The PCL-5 test scores demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .96), test-retest reliability (r = .84), and convergent and discriminant validity. Consistent with previous studies (Armour et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014), confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the data were best explained by a 6-factor anhedonia model and a 7-factor hybrid model. Signal detection analyses using the CAPS-5 revealed that PCL-5 scores of 31 to 33 were optimally efficient for diagnosing PTSD (κ(.5) = .58). Overall, the findings suggest that the PCL-5 is a psychometrically sound instrument that can be used effectively with veterans. Further, by determining a valid cutoff score using the CAPS-5, the PCL-5 can now be used to identify veterans with probable PTSD. However, findings also suggest the need for research to evaluate cluster structure of DSM-5. (PsycINFO Database Record",81

There are indications that various maltreatment types are related to PTSD severity, although not all types, such as emotional abuse, meet the PTSD Criterion-A.The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between 5 types of childhood maltreatment (i.e., sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, and physical and emotional neglect) and the severity of adult PTSD and PTSD symptoms.Adult participants (N = 147) with Childhood-related PTSD (Ch-PTSD) recruited from clinical sites completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-short form (CTQ-sf) and 2 PTSD measures: The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5).Childhood maltreatment predictors and 2 covariates, age and gender, were analysed in multivariate multilevel models as participants were nested within sites. A model selection procedure, in which all combinations of predictors were examined, was used to select a final set of predictors.The results indicated that emotional abuse was the only trauma type that was significantly related to severity of PTSD and to the severity of specific PTSD symptom clusters (r between 0.130 and 0.338). The final models explained between 6.5% and 16.7% of the variance in PTSD severity.The findings suggest that emotional abuse plays a more important role in Ch-PTSD than hitherto assumed, and that treatment should not neglect processing of childhood emotional abuse.",82

The PCL-5 is often administered in clinical settings as a screening tool for PTSD, with a suggested cutoff score of 33 indicating a probable PTSD diagnosis. Recent research indicates that a higher cutoff may be required in psychiatric samples. In the present study, we aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the PCL-5 in a Canadian outpatient psychiatric sample and establish an optimal cutoff score for detecting probable PTSD in this sample. Participants were 673 individuals who reported a history of trauma exposure and were assessed using a semistructured interview and self-report measures. Individuals diagnosed with PTSD (N = 193) reported a mean PCL-5 score of 56.57, whereas individuals without PTSD (N = 480) reported a mean score of 33.56. A score of 45 was determined to be the optimal cutoff score in this sample, balancing sensitivity and specificity while detecting a probable diagnosis of PTSD. Consistent with findings in other psychiatric samples, these findings indicate that in an outpatient psychiatric sample with a history of exposure to a variety of trauma types, a higher cutoff score is required to determine probable PTSD. In addition, given the estimated rate of false positives even with a higher cutoff, follow-up diagnostic assessments are recommended.",83

The Profile of Mood States questionnaire was administered at pre-operative assessment (T0), surgical admission (T1) and discharge from hospital (T2). The Impact of Event Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were administered at T0, T1, T2 and 2 years after discharge (T3). At 2-year follow-up, women were also asked to rate their perceived quality of life on a 0-10 visual analogue scale.Between January 2014 and April 2015, 150 women were enrolled. Results showed that more than 90% of patients experienced post-traumatic stress symptoms after cancer diagnosis (14% with severe symptoms and 76.7% with moderate symptoms) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms that persisted up to the 2-year from discharge follow-up, with significant improvement only 2 years after hospital discharge. In particular, mediation models showed that intrusive thoughts impede mood adjustment to the disease during the pre-surgical phase, with anxiety amplifying the negative effect, while symptoms of avoidance are more detrimental in the long term for patients' quality of life.PTSD symptom clusters have different influence on short- and long-term reaction to illness. Based on this evidence, appropriate interventions to manage PTSDs in the context of oncology should be developed.",84

However, the underlying factor structure of the PCL-C remains under examined, with the most recent research relying on small samples with limited generalizability. Thus, the present study used exploratory and confirmatory techniques in a large North American college student sample to investigate the factor structure of the PCL-C. Results supported a 3-factor model for the PCL-C accounting for 59% of the total variance and represented by Suppression (M = 11.2, SD = 5.0); Hyperarousal (M = 6.5, SD = 3.2); and Diminished Reward Processing (M = 5.9, SD = 2.9). Regarding gender differences, females tended to score higher on suppression and avoidance related symptoms, while males scored higher on symptoms related to Diminished Reward Processing. Results also showed that embedded within college campuses are trauma exposed students experiencing distressingly high levels of posttrauma symptoms. In sum, the results revealed three factors in the PCL-C, that could be used to offer insight into assessing and treating posttrauma symptoms on a college campus.",85

To address this concern, Brewin et al. (2009) reformulated the diagnosis around a core symptom set. Although several studies have examined the utility of the core criteria in predicting diagnostic status, none have done so using a self-report screening instrument. The sample included 617 veterans presenting for outpatient psychological services. As a part of the intake process, veterans completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Veterans meeting core criteria on the PCL-5 were over 22 times more likely to meet PCL-5 diagnosed PTSD than veterans who met the core criteria on the PCL-5 but did not meet PCL-5 diagnosed PTSD (OR = 22.94; CI [12.76, 41.25]). Further, veterans who met core criteria on the PCL-5 were over 2 times more likely (OR = 2.34; 95.0% CI [1.53, 3.59]) to meet CAPS-5 diagnosed PTSD than veterans who met the core criteria on the PCL-5 but did not meet CAPS-5 diagnosed PTSD.

This study aimed to test the development and maintenance of pain and PTSD symptom clusters, i.e., intrusions, avoidance, and hyperarousal. The longitudinal study included 216 adults with burns. PTSD symptom clusters, indexed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and pain, using a graphic numerical rating scale (GNRS), were measured during hospitalization, 3 and 6 months post-burn. Cross-lagged panel analysis was used to test the relationships between pain and PTSD symptom clusters. Cross-lagged results showed that in-hospital intrusions predicted pain and avoidance 3 months post-burn. In-hospital pain predicted intrusions and avoidance 3 months post-burn and a trend was found for hyperarousal (90% CI). In the second wave, intrusions predicted pain and hyperarousal. Pain predicted hyperarousal. This study provides support for an entangled relationship between pain and PTSD symptoms, and particularly subscribes the role of intrusions in this bidirectional relationship. To a lesser extent, hyperarousal was unidirectionally related to pain. These results may subscribe the driving role of PTSD, particularly intrusions, which partly supports the Perpetual Avoidance Model.",87

This study examined differences in rates, severity, and overlap of diagnoses using ICD-10 and ICD-11 PTSD diagnostic criteria during consecutive assessments of recent survivors of traumatic events.The study sample comprised 3863 survivors of traumatic events, evaluated in 11 longitudinal studies of PTSD. ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnostic rules were applied to the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) to derive ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnoses at different time intervals between trauma occurrence and 15 months.The ICD-11 criteria identified fewer cases than the ICD-10 across assessment intervals (range -47.09% to -57.14%). Over 97% of ICD-11 PTSD cases met concurrent ICD-10 PTSD criteria. PTSD symptom severity of individuals identified by the ICD-11 criteria (CAPS total scores) was 31.38-36.49% higher than those identified by ICD-10 criteria alone. The latter, however, had CAPS scores indicative of moderate PTSD. ICD-11 was associated with similar or higher rates of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. Individuals identified by either ICD-10 or ICD-11 shortly after traumatic events had similar longitudinal course.This study indicates that significantly fewer individuals would be diagnosed with PTSD using the proposed ICD-11 criteria. Though ICD-11 criteria identify more severe cases, those meeting ICD-10 but not ICD-11 criteria remain in the moderate range of PTSD symptoms. Use of ICD-11 criteria will have critical implications for case identification in clinical practice, national reporting, and research.",88

According to the ITQ (n = 70) 33 (47.1%) patients also fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of Complex PTSD. The 4-day treatment programme contained a combination of prolonged exposure, EMDR therapy, physical activities and psycho-education. Treatment response was measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) for classifying Complex PTSD and indexing disturbances in self-organization (DSO).Results: Overall CAPS-5, PCL-5, and ITQ-DSO scores decreased significantly from pre- to post-treatment (Cohen’s ds 2.12, 1.59, and 1.18, respectively), while the decrease was maintained to six months follow-up.

Thus existing assessment tools do not fully capture stress symptoms associated with exposure to threats that extend over months or years. To address this void, we enumerated the symptoms associate with ongoing exposure to stress including those that are distinct from existing PTSD diagnostic criteria. Objectives To develop the Continuous Traumatic Stress Response Scale (CTSR) and assess its psychometric properties. Method We sampled 313 adults exposed and unexposed to ongoing security threat between December 2016 and February 2017. Respondents lived in communities bordering the Gaza Strip in southern Israel where they are exposed to frequent rocket attacks, requiring they locate and find shelter in 30 seconds or less. We assessed the concurrent validity of CTSR relative to the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Results On the basis of exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we retained 11 of 25 items measuring three distinct factors: exhaustion/detachment, rage/betrayal, and fear/helplessness. We found moderate concurrence between the scales; that is, the CTSR appears to measure a construct related to, but distinct from PTSD. This conclusion is supported by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicating that each factor significantly contributes to measurement of a higher-order, continuous traumatic stress latent construct. Conclusions These results support the psychometric properties of CTSR. Future research is required to confirm these findings in other countries and cultures and among individuals exposed to other forms of continuous traumatic stress.",92

However, factors that link mTBI and PTSD development are still unclear. Acute stress responses after trauma have been associated with PTSD development. mTBI may impair cognitive functions and increase anxiety immediately after trauma.Objective: This research aimed to test the possibility that mTBI increases acute stress symptoms rapidly, which in turn results in PTSD development in the subsequent months.Method: Fifty-nine patients were recruited from the emergency rooms of local hospitals. Post-mTBI, acute stress, and PTSD symptom severity were measured using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS), and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), respectively.Results: Moderated mediation analysis indicated that ASDS, at 2 weeks post-trauma, mediated the relationship between RPQ scores at 2 weeks and PCL-5 scores at 3 months post-trauma, only for patients who met mTBI diagnostic criteria.Conclusions: These findings present preliminary evidence suggesting that acute stress disorder symptoms may be one of the mechanisms involved in the development of PTSD among trauma survivors who have experienced mTBI, which provides a theoretical basis for early intervention of PTSD prevention after mTBI.",93

Of these, 57.8% completed the PDS for a second time (mean time between assessments was 12.0 days). In order to examine convergent and discriminant validity of the PDS-5, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 as well as Patient Health Questionnaire subscales assessing depression (PHQ-9), somatization (PHQ-15), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) were applied.The PDS-5 total score showed excellent internal consistency (α = .91) and re-test reliability (rho = .84). Convergent validity was supported by a strong correlation with the total score of the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; rho = .91). Correlations with Patient Health Questionnaire subscales of depression (rho = .81), anxiety (rho = .72), and somatization (rho = .65) were significantly lower (all p < .001) indicating discriminant validity of the PDS-5. Confirmative Factor Analysis did not result in a clear preference for one of the tested models. Defining a diagnostic cut-off value of ≥36 based on ROC analysis resulted in high sensitivity (.92) and specificity (.96) compared to a probable PTSD diagnosis according to the PCL-5.In summary, our results indicate that the German PDS-5 translation provides valid and reliable information concerning both PTSD severity and diagnosis.Antecedentes: La disponibilidad de instrumentos psicométricamente sólidos para la evaluación del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) es indispensable para el trabajo clínico y científico con personas que sufren angustia relacionada con el trauma.Objetivo: El objetivo del presente estudio fue traducir la Escala de Diagnóstico Postraumático del DSM-5 (PDS-5) al alemán y evaluar sus propiedades psicométricas, así como su validez convergente, discriminante y factorial.Método: La traducción al alemán autorizada del PDS-5 fue completada por 270 pacientes ingresados en clínicas de trauma ambulatorias especializadas.

Participants were 64 children and adolescents (51.6% female, 45.3% African American/Black) between 8 and 18 years of age (M = 14.1, SD = 2.5) who had experienced a DSM-5 Criterion A trauma. Participants completed test-retest procedures for the self-report and interviewer versions of the CPSS-5 in 2 visits that were up to 2 weeks apart. Analyses revealed excellent internal consistencies, good to excellent test-retest reliability, and good convergent validity and discriminant validity for interview and self-report versions of the scale. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded a cutoff score of 31 on the CPSS-5 self-report version for identifying probable PTSD diagnosis. Six most frequently endorsed items by those with a possible PTSD diagnosis on the CPSS-5 were identified to constitute a screen version of the CPSS-5, showing good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The three versions of the CPSS-5 scales are valid and reliable measures of DSM-5 PTSD symptomatology in traumatized youth.",95

The objective of this study was to determine the longitudinal patterns of these typologies, especially the movement of persons across clusters of psychopathology.In this 6-year longitudinal study, 1,167 hospitalized severe injury patients who were recruited between April 2004-February 2006 were analyzed, with repeated measures at baseline, 3 months, 12 months, and 72 months after injury. All patients met the DSM-IV criterion A1 for PTSD. Structured clinical interviews were used to assess psychiatric disorders at each follow-up point. Latent class analysis and latent transition analysis were applied to assess clusters of individuals determined by psychopathology. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were employed to complete diagnoses.Four latent classes were identified at each time point: (1) Alcohol/Depression class (3 months, 2.1%; 12 months, 1.3%; and 72 months, 1.1%), (2) Alcohol class (3 months, 3.3%; 12 months, 3.7%; and 72 months, 5.4%), (3) PTSD/Depression class (3 months, 10.3%; 12 months, 11.5%; and 72 months, 6.4%), and (4) No Disorder class (3 months, 84.2%; 12 months, 83.5%; and 72 months, 87.1%). Latent transition analyses conducted across the 2 transition points (12 months and 72 months) found consistently high levels of stability in the No Disorder class (90.9%, 93.0%, respectively) but lower and reducing levels of consistency in the PTSD/Depression class (81.3%, 46.6%), the Alcohol/Depression class (59.7%, 21.5%), and the Alcohol class (61.0%, 36.5%), demonstrating high levels of between-class migration.Despite the array of psychiatric disorders that may develop following severe injury, a 4-class model best described the data with excellent classification certainty. The high levels of migration across classes indicate a complex pattern of psychopathology expression over time. The findings have considerable implications for tailoring multifocused interventions to class type, as well as flexible stepped care models, and for the potential development and delivery of transdiagnostic interventions targeting underlying mechanisms.",96

With regard to assessing posttraumatic stress symptoms, there are specific versions of measures designed for child and adolescent populations in accordance with the fourth and fifth editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV and DSM-5, respectively). Different clinical thresholds, numbers of items, and score ranges may present obstacles for clinicians and researchers attempting to compare self-report ratings across different versions of a measure. The current study aimed to produce a score conversion crosswalk between two child/adolescent self-report measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV (RI-IV) and DSM-5 (RI-5). Using item response theory (IRT), we calibrated both measures separately to derive scaled scores. The discrimination parameters ranged from 0.57 to 2.08 (SE = 0.09-0.17) for RI-IV and from 0.73 to 2.11 for RI-5 (SE = 0.07-0.13). The scaled scores were connected with equipercentile linking. Total scores based on common items between the two measures were used as anchors to enhance the linking results. A total of 1,486 children and adolescents completed the measure: 571 respondents filled out the RI-IV and 915 respondents filled out the RI-5. The results allow linked scores to be compared to establish recommended clinical cutoffs and help elucidate the implications of changes in the diagnostic criteria for the measurement of self-reported PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents.",97
https://openalex.org/W2612417324,10.1037/pas0000486,The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM–5 (CAPS-5): Development and initial psychometric evaluation in military veterans.,"The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is an extensively validated and widely used structured diagnostic interview for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The CAPS was recently revised to correspond with PTSD criteria in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This article describes the development of the CAPS for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and presents the results of an initial psychometric evaluation of CAPS-5 scores in 2 samples of military veterans (Ns = 165 and 207). CAPS-5 diagnosis demonstrated strong interrater reliability (к = .78 to 1.00, depending on the scoring rule) and test-retest reliability (к = .83), as well as strong correspondence with a diagnosis based on the CAPS for DSM-IV (CAPS-IV; к = .84 when optimally calibrated). CAPS-5 total severity score demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .88) and interrater reliability (ICC = .91) and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .78). It also demonstrated good convergent validity with total severity score on the CAPS-IV (r = .83) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (r = .66) and good discriminant validity with measures of anxiety, depression, somatization, functional impairment, psychopathy, and alcohol abuse (rs = .02 to .54). Overall, these results indicate that the CAPS-5 is a psychometrically sound measure of DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity. Importantly, the CAPS-5 strongly corresponds with the CAPS-IV, which suggests that backward compatibility with the CAPS-IV was maintained and that the CAPS-5 provides continuity in evidence-based assessment of PTSD in the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5 criteria.

A scripted imagery paradigm was used to assess initial (M = 1 month posttrauma) HR reactivity during exposure to and recovery following idiographic trauma cues. In addition, follow-up PTSD status (M = 8 months posttrauma) was assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD scale (CAPS). A logistic regression was used to predict PTSD status at the follow-up assessment with HR reactivity during exposure to a personalized trauma audio script and recovery periods at initial assessment entered hierarchically. Script HR reactivity alone did not significantly predict PTSD status. However, after adding HR recovery, the model was significant. Higher HR during recovery was significantly positively associated with PTSD-positive status while script HR reactivity remained a non-significant predictor. The model correctly classified 70% of cases with PTSD. A second logistic regression with initial CAPS severity as a covariate showed that HR recovery added predictive value beyond acute PTSD symptoms. These results suggest that HR recovery following trauma cue exposure is an important predictor of PTSD development.",99

Participants included hospitalized survivors of physical injury who underwent a 2-step evaluation for PTSD symptoms. Patients reporting high levels of distress on the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C) were randomized (N = 635) per the stepped-wedge protocol to enhanced usual care control (n = 370) or intervention (n = 265) conditions. The study was conducted from January 4, 2016, through November 2018. Data analysis was performed from November 4, 2019, to December 8, 2020.The Trauma Survivors Outcomes and Support collaborative care intervention included proactive injury case management that assisted patients transitioning from hospital inpatient to outpatient and community settings. The intervention also integrated evidence-based pharmacotherapy and psychotherapeutic elements targeting PTSD symptoms and comorbidity.The primary study outcome was PTSD symptoms assessed with the PCL-C at baseline in the surgical ward and at 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Secondary outcomes included depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and physical function. Subgroup analyses examined the effect of baseline risk factors for enduring PTSD and quality of protocol implementation on study outcomes. Primary statistical analyses were conducted using the intent-to-treat sample.A total of 327 men (51.5%) were included in analysis; mean (SD) age was 39.0 (14.2) years. The investigation attained follow-up of 75% to 80% of the participants at 3 to 12 months. The intervention lasted a mean (SD) of 122 (132) minutes. Mixed model regression analyses revealed statistically significant changes in PCL-C scores for intervention patients compared with control patients at 6 months (difference, -2.57; 95% CI, -5.12 to -0.03; effect size, 0.18; P < .05) but not 12 months (difference, -1.27; 95% CI, -4.26 to 1.73; effect size, 0.08; P = .35). Subgroup analyses revealed larger PTSD treatment effects for patients with 3 or more baseline risk factors for enduring PTSD and for patients, including firearm injury survivors, treated at trauma centers with good or excellent protocol implementation. Intervention effects for secondary outcomes did not attain statistical significance.A brief stepped collaborative care intervention was associated with significant 6-month but not 12-month PTSD symptom reductions. Greater baseline PTSD risk and good or excellent trauma center protocol implementation were associated with larger PTSD treatment effects. Orchestrated efforts targeting policy and funding should systematically incorporate the study findings into national trauma center requirements and verification criteria.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02655354.",100

https://openalex.org/W2801524682,,Prevalencia de trastorno de estrés postraumàtico en pacientes heridos en combate hospitalizados en el Hospital Militar Central Bogota Servicio de Psiquiatria,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that arises as a delayed or delayed response to a stressful event or to a situation (brief or lasting) of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, real or imagined, that would cause widespread discomfort in almost all the world. In the USA and according to the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, conducted between February 2001 and April 2003, it was estimated that PTSD prevalence of 6.8%. A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed at the Central Military Hospital where a PTSD prevalence of 16.66%
Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of acute stress disorder (TEA) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by means of semi-structured interview of DSM5, in military patients hospitalized in combat at the Central Military Hospital (HMC) Bogota psychiatric service.
Methodology: An observational, descriptive study was carried out. Prospective, prevalence where all military patients injured in combat who were hospitalized in the HMC were included. The signing of the informed consent was made at the entrance, in addition the scale of risk factors and the PC-PTS scale were performed and, if the scale was positive, a structured interview was performed for the diagnosis of ASD. A second scale of PC-PTS was performed 15 days after the traumatic event, if this was positive, the interview was performed for TEA. A third, fourth and fifth PC-PTS were then applied at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the traumatic event. If someone gave a positive result the diagnostic interview for PTSD was applied. Upon confirmation of the diagnosis, the patient entered the post-traumatic stress clinic of the HMC psychiatry service.
Results: 102 subjects with a history of having been injured in combat and hospitalized in HMC met the selection criteria. After the application of scales for acute stress, posttraumatic stress and semi-structured interviews, the respective diagnosis was made. The prevalence of ASD at admission and 15 days after the traumatic event was 1.96%. And prevalence of PTSD at 3,921%, at 3 months at 4.90% and at 6 months at 10.78%. It was found that two patients with PTSD diagnoses at one month had a history of TEA
Conclusions In our study we observed a prevalence of PTSD is similar to the worldwide prevalence, but a lower prevalence found in HMC. As our study is only descriptive, analytical studies should be performed to look at the risk factors associated with the onset of this pathology",102

However, most research on this topic was based on self-report data. We aimed to investigate the latent structure of PTSD based on a clinical interview, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5).A clinical sample of 345 participants took part in this multi-centre study. Participants were assessed with the CAPS-5 and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5). We evaluated eight competing models of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and three competing models of ICD-11 PTSD symptoms.The internal consistency of the CAPS-5 was replicated. In CFAs, the Anhedonia model emerged as the best fitting model within all tested DSM-5 models. However, when compared with the Anhedonia model, the non-nested ICD-11 model as a less complex three-factor solution showed better model fit indices.We discuss the findings in the context of earlier empirical findings as well as theoretical models of PTSD.Introducción: Muchos estudios han investigado la estructura latente de los criterios DSM-5 para el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT).

The treatment outcomes of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and of patients with CPTSD were compared by a t-test for depended samples and a repeated-measures ANOVA.The LCA revealed two distinct classes: a PTSD class characterized by elevated core symptoms of PTSD (n = 62) and low symptoms of disturbances in self-organization versus a complex PTSD class with elevated PTSD core symptoms and elevated symptoms of disturbances in self-organization (n = 93). The Group × Time interaction regarding posttraumatic stress symptoms was not significant. Pre-post effect sizes regarding posttraumatic stress symptoms were large for both groups (PTSD: d = 2.81; CPTSD: d = 1.37). For disturbances in self-organization in the CPTSD class, we found medium to large effect sizes (d = 0.40-1.16) after treatment with TF-CBT.The results provide empirical evidence of the ICD-11 CPTSD and PTSD distinction in a clinical sample of children and adolescents. In terms of relative improvement from their respective baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms, patients with PTSD and CPTSD responded equally to TF-CBT; however, those with CPTSD ended treatment with clinically and statistically greater symptoms than those with PTSD.",107

In recent years, several trauma-focused therapies (TFTs), including cognitive restructuring (CR), prolonged exposure (PE), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) have been studied and found to be safe and effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in individuals with psychosis. However, studies were conducted in different countries, with varying inclusion criteria, therapy duration, control groups, and trial outcomes. RE.PROCESS will be the first study to compare the impact of CR, PE and EMDR with a waiting list control condition within the same context.Methods and analysis: This is the protocol of a pragmatic, single-blind, multicentre, superiority randomized controlled trial, in which CR, PE, and EMDR are compared to a waiting list control condition for TFT (WL) in a naturalistic treatment setting. Inclusion criteria are: Age ≥ 16 years; meeting full DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), with a total CAPS score ≥ 23; and a psychotic disorder in the schizophrenia spectrum confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). Participants (N = 200) will be randomly allocated to 16 sessions of one of the TFTs or WL, in addition to receiving treatment as usual (TAU) for psychosis. The primary objective is to compare the effects of CR, PE, and EMDR to WL on researcher-rated severity of PTSD symptoms over time from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Secondary objectives are to examine these effects at the separate time-points (i.e. mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up) and to test the effects for clinician-rated presence of PTSD diagnosis, and self-rated severity of (complex) PTSD symptoms.Discussion: This is the first RCT to directly compare the effects of CR, PE and EMDR within the same context to TAU on PTSD symptoms in individuals with psychosis and PTSD. Secondary effects on clinical and functional outcomes will be investigated both directly after therapy and long-term.Trial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN56150327.

However, some stroke patients develop persistent and disabling symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Data on post-stroke post-traumatic stress disorder (PS-PTSD) is sparse. Methods: We conducted a single-center observational pilot study of 20 adult patients diagnosed with stroke or TIA in the previous 31 days to 1 year. Patients completed the PTSD Check List-5 (PCL-5), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), stroke specific Quality of Life Scale-12 (SS-QOL-12), modified Rankin Scale of disability, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. The PCL-5 is a 20 item self-report score assessing symptoms of re-experiencing (Criterion B), avoidance (Criterion C), negative alterations in cognition or mood (Criterion D), and hyperarousal (Criterion E). Subjects were classified as having PS-PTSD with PCL-5 score ≥33 or endorsement of moderate symptoms in at least one B item, one C item, two D items, and two E items. Results: Twenty patients completed the PCL-5 and 19 completed the follow up scales. Seven patients (35%) were found to have PS-PTSD. Higher PCL-5 scores were significantly correlated with lower SS-QOL12 scores indicating worsened quality of life (r= -0.709, P=.001) and higher PHQ9 scores representing more depressive symptoms (r= 0.727, P&lt;0.001). The effect was most prominent in the SS-QOL-12 domains of mood, language, upper extremity function, and family roles (Table 1). Conclusion: PS-PTSD was found to be prevalent after stroke and TIA with 35% of patients having significant PTSD symptomology. These patients were also more likely to have concurrent depressive symptoms and worsened quality of life.",110

Road Traffic Accident (RTA) is one of the traumatic experiences, which may result in post-traumatic stress disorder. But, treatment is mainly concentrated on physical health. This may be due to a lack of evidence in low-income countries. Aim: To determine the incidence level and identify risk factors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after RTA. Methods: Longitudinal panel study was done to assess the incidence of PTSD after RTA. The study was conducted in three orthopedic settings of Bahir Dar town Northwest, Ethiopia. The study was on 299 adult car accident survivors. PTSD Checklist (PCL) civilian version, Sheehan disability assessment scale, Patient Health Question (PHQ -2) and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) were instruments to assess the outcome and associated factors. The generalized linear model with Poisson log-linear method was applied to identify associated factors. Ethical clearance was obtained from Bahir Dar University. Individuals with PTSD symptoms were linked to the psychiatric clinic. Result: One hundred thirty-nine (46.5%) participants had at least three extremely severe symptoms which fulfill criteria B, C and D of Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV of PTSD. The most frequent severe symptoms were having repeated, disturbing memories, thoughts, or images. Two hundred ten (70.2%) participants reported the extreme impact of the accident on work or schooling and 156(51.9%) report extreme problems in social functioning. Alcohol dependence, hazardous alcohol consumption, and harmful use were reported by 7.9%, 15.1% and 4.7% of the participants respectively. In the final model witnessing death, severe sleep problem and severe impairment in family functioning were significantly associated with PTSD. Conclusion: Nearly half of RTA survivors develop PTSD. Clinicians need to link these patients to the psychiatry clinic. Special attention should be given to patients who witnessed death, with a serious disability and previous psychiatric history.",111

This article sheds light on hitherto unvisited methodological issues, reappraising several key models advanced for the DSM-IV-based civilian version of the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C) as to their configural and metric structures. Methods: The sample comprised 456 women, interviewed at 6-8 weeks postpartum, who attended a high-complexity facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation models (ESEM) were used to evaluate the dimensional structure of the PCL-C. Results: The original three-factor solution was rejected, along with the four-factor structures most widely endorsed in the literature (PTSD-dysphoria and PTSD-numbing models). Further exploration supported a model comprised of two factors (re-experience/avoidance and numbing/hyperarousal). Conclusion: These findings are at odds with the dimensional structure proposed in both DSM-IV and DSM-5. This also entails a different presumption regarding the latent structure of PTSD and how the PCL should be operationalized.",112

A structured clinician-administered PTSD Scale then assessed the patients for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (CAPS-5) to establish a final diagnosis. The assessment of the severity of PTSD was done based on various types of oral and maxillofacial injuries.  Results: The IES-R scale provisionally diagnosed 54 subjects with PTSD, out of which 42 were diagnosed to have PTSD by the CAPS-5 scale. Subjects with injuries involving the ‘orbital complex,’ those presenting with a perceptible scar in the maxillofacial region and with multiple avulsed/ luxated anterior teeth, showed a higher affinity to develop PTSD, and this was statistically significant .  Conclusion:  Higher levels of PTSD in patients with injuries to the maxillofacial region warrants correct diagnosis and detection, and hence the maxillofacial surgeon plays a vital role in this regard. The IES-R is a useful diagnostic tool to detect PTSD early.",113

Although this short scale has excellent psychometric properties its cut-off scores for potential clinical use have yet to be established. In addition, due to the discrepancy between the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in the meaurement of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the present study aimed at revalidating the STO and establishing cut-off scores for potential clinical use, based on both approaches to measure PTSD and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD). Three hundred forty-three adults who were recruited through social media apps filled in self-report online questionnaires dealing with subjective perception of psychological trauma, PTSD and CPTSD. Results revalidate the STO as a screening tool for PTSD and CPTSD. We recommend a STO cut-off score of 13 and above when using the ICD-11 PTSD proposed algorithm along the PCL-5 cutoff score and a STO cut-off score of 15 when using the ICD-11 CPTSD proposed algorithm. In light of the present findings, the integration of DSM and ICD approaches is discussed.",114

The IES-R measures symptoms of posttraumatic stress based on the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Method: Fifty participants diagnosed with serious mental illness (SMI) participated in the current study. The IES-R was administered along with the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Results: Following the method used by Thoresen et al. (2010) forward stepwise regression was employed, with the first two items with the strongest predictability retained for each group of symptoms (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal). However, these analyses did not support the IES-6 as originally presented. Therefore, an alternative, eight-item measure (IES-8) in accordance with the updated PTSD diagnostic criteria (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) was ultimately proposed. The IES-8 is comprised of two items each per the DSM-5’s four symptom groups (intrusion, physical avoidance, altered mood and cognitions, and hyperarousal. Descriptive data and correlations with the BSI are presented. Conclusion: Our results did not support the IES-6 model as proposed originally by Thoresen et al. Rather, the data suggested a revised, eight-item model to account for the DSM-5’s PTSD diagnostic criteria. Individuals interested in using an IES-R short form in research or practice should proceed with due caution as any short form is likely to vary by population.",115

While numerous symptom combinations are possible to meet diagnostic criteria, simplification of this heterogeneity of symptom presentations may have clinical utility. In a nationally representative sample of American adults with lifetime DSM-5 PTSD diagnoses from the third wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n = 2,365), we used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify qualitatively distinct PTSD symptom typologies. Subsequently, we used linear and logistic regressions to identify demographic, trauma-related, and psychiatric characteristics associated with membership in each class. In contrast to prior LCAs with DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria, fit indices for the present analyses of DSM-5 PTSD revealed a four-class solution to the data: Dysphoric (23.8%), Threat-Reactivity (26.1%), High Symptom (33.7%), and Low Symptom (16.3%). Exploratory analyses revealed distinctions between classes in socioeconomic impairment, trauma exposure, comorbid diagnoses, and demographic characteristics. Although the study is limited by its cross-sectional design (preventing analysis of temporal associations or causal pathways between covariates and latent classes), findings may support efforts to develop personalized medicine approaches to PTSD diagnosis and treatment.",116

Patterns of PTSD symptom change are not well understood. Thus, the current study was designed to categorize and investigate potential predictors of symptom trajectories in patients with PTSD. The sample comprised 2,237 VA patients who were diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 and completed at least 4 PTSD Checklist (PCL) assessments over 12 weeks. Latent trajectory analysis was used to identify latent classes of patients based on PCL scores. Based on model fit indices, 3 trajectories were identified. Compared to patients in the mild-improving trajectory (21.9%), those in the severe-stable trajectory (34.3%) were more likely to be male, relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.48, 95% CI [1.08, 2.02]; non-White, RRR = 1.77, 95% CI [1.33, 2.35]; Hispanic, RRR = 2.07, 95% CI [1.40, 3.04]; and have comorbid depression, RRR = 1.58, 95% CI [1.25, 1.99]. Compared to patients in the moderate-improving trajectory (43.8%), those in the severe-stable trajectory were more likely to have sleep disorders, RRR = 1.25, 95% CI [1.01, 1.55]. Our findings suggest that male veterans, minority veterans, and veterans with certain comorbid conditions may be less likely to achieve improved PTSD symptoms. Targeted efforts are needed to improve outcomes for PTSD patients on nonremitting trajectories and to improve the consistency of PTSD assessment across the VA health care system.",117

Disorders specifically associated with stress will be included in a separate chapter in ICD-11, and will include a revision of ICD-10 PTSD as well as a new diagnosis of complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD). The proposed symptom structures of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD have been validated in several studies previously, however few studies have used the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), a specific measure for ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD. Given that ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD diagnoses are intended to be applicable across different cultures and nations, it is important that the constructs be evaluated across diverse populations and languages.Objective: Study of the psychological impact of trauma is relatively new in Lithuania, coinciding with its independence from the Soviet Union in the 1990s. Studies thus far reveal a population suffering from the effects of long-term and systematic political oppression and violence. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the symptoms and structure of PTSD and CPTSD in a Lithuanian treatment-seeking sample as measured by the ITQ.Method: A total of 280 patients from outpatient mental health centres participated in this study. PTSD and CPTSD symptoms were measured with the ITQ. We applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and latent class analysis (LCA) for analysis of data.Results and conclusions: Our study supported the ICD-11 factor structure of CPTSD, and a three-class model was supported in LCA analysis with a PTSD class, a CPTSD class, and a low symptom class.

Nevertheless, it still remains a disease that represents a real threat to a child’s life. This threat as well as a deep fear for a child’s life which is strongly associated with it have a key impact on psychological difficulties experienced by parents at the time of establishing their child’s diagnosis and throughout therapy. Aim: The study was focused on assessment of the dynamics of posttraumatic symptoms intensity in parents of children suffering from blood cancers depending on a period of time that passed since the moment the disease was diagnosed. Materials and methods: A prospective study model was applied – the parents were assessed at three time points, i.e. up to one month (t1), six months (t2) and one year (t3) following their child’s diagnosis. The study included 47 parents of children diagnosed with leukaemia or lymphoma. The number of the subjects taking part in successive measurements was 32 (t2) and 31 (t3), respectively. The Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R) was used to assess severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms in the parents. Results: Severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms in the parents decreased within one year following their child’s diagnosis. An analysis of intensity of particular dimensions of posttraumatic stress at the successive time points revealed their variability. The level of symptoms related to avoidance did not decrease significantly in the period between one and six months following the diagnosis, or between six months and one year following the diagnosis. Conclusions: The study results provide grounds for putting forward of recommendations concerning diagnostic and therapeutic measures. At the time of diagnosis, parents should be provided with special psychological intervention, whereas, at next stages of a child’s treatment, therapists should focus their attention mostly on avoidance symptoms and the role they play in the process of parents’ adaptation to their child’s illness.",120

However, they are not always feasible to deliver due a shortage of trained therapists and demands on the patient. An online trauma-focused Guided Self-Help (GSH) programme which could overcome these barriers has shown promise in a pilot study. This study will be the first to evaluate GSH against standard face-to-face therapy to assess its suitability for use in the NHS. The study is a large-scale multi-centre pragmatic randomised controlled non-inferiority trial, with assessors masked to treatment allocation. One hundred and ninety-two participants will be randomly allocated to receive either face-to-face trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TFCBT) or trauma-focused online guided self-help (GSH). The primary outcome will be the severity of symptoms of PTSD over the previous week as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM5 (CAPS-5) at 16 weeks post-randomisation. Secondary outcome measures include PTSD symptoms over the previous month as measured by the CAPS-5 at 52 weeks plus the Impact of Event Scale – revised (IES-R), Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Alcohol Use Disorders Test (AUDIT-O), Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), short Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES) measured at 16 and 52 weeks post-randomisation. Changes in health-related quality of life will be measured by the EQ-5D and the level of healthcare resource utilisation for health economic analysis will be determined by an amended version of the Client Socio-Demographic and Service Receipt Inventory European Version. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) will be collected at 16 weeks post-randomisation to evaluate treatment satisfaction. This study will be the first to compare online GSH with usual face-to-face therapy for PTSD. The strengths are that it will test a rigorously developed intervention in a real world setting to inform NHS commissioning. The potential challenges of delivering such a pragmatic study may include participant recruitment, retention and adherence, therapist retention, and fidelity of intervention delivery.

Recently, the PCL has been updated based on the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD Objectives: The present study aimed to determine the psychometric properties and diagnostic capability of the PCL as a screening tool in an earthquake-stricken population in Kermanshah, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 injured earthquake victims in Sales and Javanrud counties. The subjects were selected via purposive sampling. The PCL was translated into Kurdish (Surani), and trained interviewers run the translated version for 200 individuals manifesting the symptoms of post-earthquake stress in the earthquake-stricken cities of Javanrud and Sales located in Kermanshah province. After two weeks, 100 participants were randomly selected, and the questionnaire was completed again. Results: The internal consistency of the PCL (α = 85%) was indicative of the validity of the checklist. The Youden’s index with the cutoff point of 23 was considered optimal for the PCL tool. The diagnostic values of sensitivity and specificity were estimated at 0.82 and 0.81, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, the test-retest results were equal after two weeks (α = 87%), indicating the high reliability of the checklist. Conclusions: According to the results, the PCL is a sensitive and accurate tool for assessing the status of PTSD in disaster victims and accidents and could be used in the screening of PTSD in the health monitoring programs for these victims.",122

This study aimed to provide a Chinese translation and psychometric evaluation of the ITQ-CA using a sample of mental-health service seeking adolescents in Mainland China. Methods The ITQ-CA was translated and back-translated from English to simplified Chinese and finalized with consensus from an expert panel. Adolescents ages 12–17 were recruited via convenience sampling from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Mainland China. Participants completed the ITQ-CA; measures of four criterion variables (depression, anxiety, stress, adverse childhood experiences); and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Construct validity, concurrent validity, and comparison of PTSD caseness between ICD-11 and DSM-5 measures were assessed. Results The final sample consisted of 111 Chinese adolescents (78% female; mean age of 15.23), all diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated the two-factor second-order model provided optimal fit. All criterion variables were positively and significant correlated with the six ITQ-CA symptom cluster summed scores. In the present sample, 69 participants (62.16%) met symptom criteria for ICD-PTSD or CPTSD using the ITQ-CA, and 73 participants (65.77%) met caseness for DSM-5 PTSD using the PCL-5. Rates of PTSD symptom cluster endorsement and caseness deriving from both diagnostic systems were comparable. Conclusions The Chinese ITQ-CA has acceptable psychometric properties and confers additional benefits in identifying complex presentations of trauma-related responses in younger people seeking mental health services.",123

CLINICAL PROFILE AND PREVALENCE OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS AMONG SERVICE-USERS REFERRED FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL FOLLOW-UP: UTILITY OF ASSESSING SYMPTOMS SEVERITY RANGE,"Abstract Background Individuals with psychosis and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) typically present with more severe forms of illness. Subthreshold posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are also likely to cause significant distress. There is a need to enhance screening processes for distressing PTSS to encourage appropriate referral to specialized services. The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a widely used self-report to assess PTSS, though there is concern regarding its validity for use in psychosis. If people scoring in the severe PTSS range on the PCL-5 also present with clinical profiles similar to those typically meeting diagnosis for PTSD, it will justify considering a broader range of PTSS and support the use of the PCL-5 as a brief screener. A severe range will arguably capture a wider array of individuals, including those with subthreshold PTSS who also likely require trauma-focused intervention. Methods One hundred and two individuals with psychosis completed the PCL-5 and a battery of clinical scales as part of an intake evaluation following referral for psychological follow-up at a clinic specializing in psychosocial interventions for psychosis. Prevalence and type of DSM-5 criterion A event were explored in conjunction with PTSS severity and referral-type. Pearson correlations identified clinical variables associated with PCL-5 total scores and were subsequently entered into a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with dichotomized PTSS severity categories (low, moderate, severe). Post hoc analyses explored significant interactions. Results Of the 102 participants, 21.6% reported no prior trauma and 14.7% reported non-valid events. Sixty-five participants were included in the analysis; 6.2% of which were referred for trauma. 81.5% reported criterion A events, 10.8% reported psychosis-related events, and 7.7% did not disclose an event. PCL-5 scores were dichotomized using the 33rd and 66th percentiles, translating into low (≤ 24), moderate (25–47), and severe (≥48) groups. Delusion severity and subjective stress, anxiety, depression, social anxiety, quality of life (QoL), and wellbeing were entered into a one-way MANOVA with PTSS severity groups. Significant main effects surviving Bonferroni correction emerged for all variables except delusion severity (F(2,40) = 3.06, p = .058) and wellbeing (F(2,56) = 1.50, p =.233). Stress (F(2,62) = 7.37, p = .001) was higher in the severe (M = 13.13, SD = 5.18) versus low group (M = 7.05, SD = 4.40, p = .001). Anxiety (F(2,62) = 8.02, p = .001) was also higher in the severe (M = 12.30, SD = 5.07) compared to low group (M = 5.85, SD = 5.06, p = .000), and depression (F(2,62) = 5.37, p = .007) was additionally higher in the severe (M = 12.61, SD = 5.73) compared to low group (M = 7.20, SD = 4.97, p = .005). Finally, social anxiety (F(2,58) = 4.25, p = .026.) was higher in the severe (M = 7.76, SD = 3.58) versus low group (M = 4.68, SD = 3.68, p = .029), while QoL (F(2,58) = 3.47, p = .038) was lower in the severe (M = 49.95, SD = 10.99) compared to low group (M = 58.95, SD = 13.76, p = .037). Discussion Due to a relatively high number of invalid questionnaires (14.7%), service users should likely complete the PCL-5 in the presence of a health-care practitioner. Findings suggest inadequate referral rates for specialized services when they may indeed benefit the service-user. Severe PTSS was associated with increased symptoms of subjective anxiety, depression, stress, social anxiety, and decreased QoL, regardless of whether diagnostic criteria for PTSD was met. A severe PTSS category likely captures a broader range of individuals requiring specialized intervention and speaks to an important need to both facilitate and increase referral rate for trauma-focused therapy.",124

Research has modeled PTSD as a network of interacting symptoms according to both diagnostic systems, but the relations between the two systems remain unclear regarding which symptoms are more central or interconnected. To answer this question, the present study is the first study to investigate the combined network structure of PTSD symptoms according to both systems using validated measurements (i.e., the International Trauma Questionnaire [ITQ] and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 5 [PCL-5] across two distinct trauma samples [a community sample, N = 2,367], and a military sample, N = 657).We estimated two Gaussian Graphical Models of the combined ICD-11 and DSM-5 PTSD symptoms across the two samples.Five of the six most central symptoms were the same across both samples.The results underline that a combination of five symptoms representing both diagnostic systems may hold central positions and potentially be important for treatment. However, the implications depend on if the different diagnostic descriptions can be reconciled in an indexical rather than constitutive perspective.

In the first stage, the translation and back-translation of CAPS-CA-5 into European Portuguese was carried out. In the second stage, the version obtained in the previous step was subjected to a pre-test. In the third stage, the final version of CAPS-CA-5, the KIDCOPE questionnaires and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-Children were applied to 101 children who had experienced at least one potentially traumatic event. The children included in this study were between seven and 18 years old and had a follow-up period in a Child Psychiatry or Pediatrics Clinic in one of the three hospitals involved in this project of at least one month.Results: Regarding the confirmatory factor analysis, our results show that the CAPS-CA-5 is a suitable psychometric instrument to assess the diagnosis and symptoms severity of post-traumatic stress disorder according to DSM-5. Convergent validity was comparable to its original version. Although there were negative relationships with almost all of its clusters, these were not statistically significant when applied with the positive coping strategies of the KIDCOPE. The European Portuguese version of the CAPS-CA-5 showed a good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α for the total scale was 0.89).Conclusion: The European Portuguese version of CAPS-CA-5 has similar psychometric properties to its original version",127

We used Latent Class Growth Mixture Modeling (LCGMM) to identify subgroups of bereaved individuals sharing similar trajectories for each disorder. We used repeated measures ANOVA to evaluate differences in individual symptoms between trajectories. Finally, we investigated to what extent chronic trajectories of these three disorders co-occurred.Three trajectories of PG symptoms emerged: resilient (66.4%), chronic (25.1%) and acute recovery (8.4%). The overall severity and symptom profile of the acute recovery group were indistinguishable from that of the chronic group through 6 months post-bereavement, followed by reduction in PG from 6 to 18 months post-bereavement. Chronic PTS in the first-year post-bereavement tended to co-occur with chronic PG and/or chronic depression.Twenty five percent of those with initial elevations in grief recovered in the period of 6 to 12 months post-bereavement. These findings highlight the clinical importance of severe grief in the initial months following loss, but also suggests caution in diagnosing a grief disorder within the first-year post-bereavement.",128

Development of the Post Traumatic Symptom scale from a clinician-based perspective,"Nations marked by a Marxist-Leninist ideology have suffered greatly due to a culture of abuse emphasized by the absolute absence of psychology, thus contributing to a diminished ability in recognizing the consequences of traumatic experiences.To improve the assessment of the presence and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in such a cultural context, our paper aimed at developing an alternative self-report measure for PTSD - the Post Traumatic Symptom Scale (PTSs), developed by clinicians with wide relevant expertise, based on the natural language people use to describe its subjective experience. This research used multiple samples consistent with the corresponding objectives. Mokken Scale Analysis and the Classical Test Theory were both employed. The proposed scale was tested against five competing PTSD models, whilst also investigating the symptoms' clusters in two different samples by using, to our knowledge, a network analysis approach for the first time.The results indicated excellent psychometric properties regarding internal consistency and temporal reliability, as well as convergent and discriminant validity. The results of MSA showed that the scale fully conforms to the assumptions of the monotone homogeneity model, interpreted as positive evidence for its use in clinical purposes. The factor analyses pointed that the newer models outperformed the standard DSM-5 model, with bifactor models displaying better fit indexes than second-order models. Finally, a distinct pattern of symptom activation in the high-risk group (i.e. first-responders) was found, bringing support for symptoms overlapping between PTSD and affective disorders, thus reinforcing the idea of bridge symptoms which has significant clinical implications.This study presents an alternative sound instrument for measuring PTSD symptomatology focused on how people naturally describe their subjective experiences. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed alongside limitations.The construction of PTSs encompasses cultural trauma and one's subjective experience.PTSs was tested against the five major competing models of PTSD.Network analyses suggest different patterns in a student sample vs. a first-responders one, with the accent on the negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM) model.Las naciones marcadas por una ideología Marxista-Leninista han sufrido en gran manera debido a una cultura de abuso enfatizada por la ausencia absoluta de psicología, contribuyendo por tanto a una disminución de la habilidad para reconocer las consecuencias de las experiencias traumáticas.Para mejorar la evaluación de la presencia y severidad del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) en tal contexto cultural, nuestro trabajo apuntó a desarrollar una medida alternativa de auto-reporte para el TEPT – La escala de síntomas postraumáticos (PTSs, por su sigla en inglés), desarrollada por clínicos con amplia experticia relevante, basada en el lenguaje natural que utiliza la gente para describir las experiencias subjetivas.Esta investigación utilizó múltiples muestras consistentes con los correspondientes objetivos. Se utilizó tanto el Análisis de Escalas de Mokken (MSA, por su sigla en inglés) como la Teoría Clásica de los Tests. La escala propuesta fue probada contra 5 modelos alternativos de TEPT, a la vez que se investigaron las agrupaciones de síntomas en dos muestras diferentes expuestas a trauma utilizando, según nuestro conocimiento, un enfoque de análisis de red por primera vez.Los resultados indicaron excelentes propiedades psicométricas en lo que respecta a consistencia interna y confiabilidad temporal, así como también validez convergente y discriminante. Los resultados del MSA mostraron que la escala se ajusta totalmente a las presunciones del modelo de homogeneidad monótona, interpretado como evidencia positiva para su uso con fines clínicos.Los análisis factoriales apuntaron a que los nuevos modelos superaron al modelo estándar DSM.-5, con mejores índices de ajuste en los modelos bifactoriales que en los de segundo orden. Finalmente, se encontró un patrón distinto de activación sintomática en el grupo de alto riesgo (ej. equipos de primera respuesta), otorgando soporte a la superposición de síntomas entre el TEPT y los trastornos afectivos, reforzando por tanto la idea de síntomas puente que tiene implicaciones clínicas significativas.Este estudio presenta un instrumento alternativo para medir la sintomatología de TEPT enfocada en cómo la gente describe naturalmente sus experiencias subjetivas. Se discuten las implicancias teóricas y prácticas junto a las limitaciones.背景: 以马克思列宁主义意识形态为标志的国家由于完全缺乏心理学所强调的虐待文化而遭受了巨大损失，从而导致识别创伤经历后果的能力下降.为了在这样的文化背景下改进对创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的存在和严重程度的评估，我们的论文旨在开发一种替代的PTSD自我报告测量方法——由具有广泛相关专业知识的临床医生开发的、基于人们用来描述主观体验的自然语言的创伤后症状量表（PTS）.本研究采用多个符合相应目的的样本。 Mokken 量表分析和经典测试理论都被采用。提出的量表检验了 5 个PTSD 竞争模型，同时也首次使用了据我们所知的网络分析方法研究了两个不同创伤暴露样本中的症状簇.结果表明，在内部一致性和时间信度以及收敛效度和判别效度方面具有优异的心理测量特性。 MSA结果表明，该量表完全符合单调同质模型的假设，被解释为其临床应用的积极证据。因子分析表明，较新的模型优于标准 DSM-5 模型，双因子模型表现出比二阶模型更好的拟合指数。最后，在高危人群（即急救人员）中发现了一种独特的症状激活模式，为 PTSD 和情感障碍之间的症状重叠提供了支持，从而强化了具有显著临床意义的桥症状的想法.本研究提出了一种用于测量 PTSD 症状的替代测量工具，重点关注人们如何自然地描述他们的主观体验。理论和实际意义与局限性一起讨论.",129

This systematic review aimed to assess and compare measurement tools. A literature search using key words ‘complex post traumatic stress disorder’, ‘PTSD’, and ‘assessment’ was undertaken on Embase and PsychINFO during February 2022 by two reviewers. Inclusion criteria included full text papers between 2002–2022 which evaluated CPTSD using assessment tools. Exclusion criteria included reviews, editorials, meta-analyses, or conference abstracts. Twenty-two papers met selection criteria. Thirteen studies used the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ). Two studies each evaluated CPTSD with the International Trauma Interview (ITI) or Symptoms of Trauma Scale (SOTS). The Developmental Trauma Inventory (DTI), Cameron Complex Trauma Interview (CCTI), Complex PTSD Item Set additional to the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (COPISAC), Complex Trauma Questionnaire (ComplexTQ), and Scale 8 of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Scale (MMPI) were used by a single study each. The ITQ was the most thoroughly investigated, validated across different populations, and is a convenient questionnaire for screening within the clinical setting. Where self-report measures are inappropriate, the ITI, SOTS, and COPISAC are interview tools which detect CPTSD. However, they require further validation and should be used alongside clinical history and examination.",130

All participants were assessed for PTSD and CPTSD using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to explore the factor structure of CPTSD in a sample of Chinese children. Latent class analysis (LCA) was employed to evaluate the discriminant validity of CPTSD symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression analyses determined associations between the different classes and traumatic events.Results: The CFA results showed that the first-order six-factor model was identified as the best-fitting model in Chinese children aged 9–12 years. Four different classes, CPTSD symptoms, PTSD symptoms, disturbances in self-organization (DSO) symptoms, and a low symptom class were found by LCA. Both prolonged interpersonal trauma and other types of trauma were risk factors for the CPTSD class and the PTSD class.Conclusions: The results of this study partially support the factorial validity and strongly support the discriminant validity of the ICD-11 proposals for PTSD and CPTSD in Chinese children, supporting the conceptualization of PTSD and CPTSD as sibling diagnoses based on the ICD-11. However, findings suggest the need for careful consideration of identified trauma types in the ICD-11 proposals.",131

Studies to date have been site and sample specific. Towards developing generalizable models of PTSD development and prediction, the International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP) compiled data from 13 longitudinal, acute-care based PTSD studies performed in six different countries. Objective: The objectives of this study were to describe the ICPP's approach to data pooling and harmonization, and present cross-study descriptive results informing the longitudinal course of PTSD after acute trauma. Methods: Item-level data from 13 longitudinal studies of adult civilian trauma survivors were collected. Constructs (e.g. PTSD, depression), measures (questions or scales), and time variables (days from trauma) were identified and harmonized, and those with inconsistent coding (e.g. education, lifetime trauma exposure) were recoded. Administered in 11 studies, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) emerged as the main measure of PTSD diagnosis and severity. Results: The pooled data set included 6254 subjects (39.9% female). Studies' average retention rate was 87.0% (range 49.1-93.5%). Participants' baseline assessments took place within 2 months of trauma exposure. Follow-up durations ranged from 188 to 1110 days. Reflecting studies' inclusion criteria, the prevalence of baseline PTSD differed significantly between studies (range 3.1-61.6%), and similar differences were observed in subsequent assessments (4.3-38.2% and 3.8-27.0% for second and third assessments, respectively). Conclusion: Pooling data from independently collected studies requires careful curation of individual data sets for extracting and optimizing informative commonalities. However, it is an important step towards developing robust and generalizable prediction models for PTSD and can exceed findings of single studies. The large differences in prevalence of PTSD longitudinally cautions against using any individual study to infer trauma outcome. The multiplicity of instruments used in individual studies emphasizes the need for common data elements in future studies.Antecedentes: Comprender el desarrollo del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) es una condición previa para una evaluación de riesgos y una planificación de prevención eficientes. Los estudios hasta la fecha han sido específicos del sitio y de la muestra. Hacia el desarrollo de modelos generalizables de desarrollo y predicción de TEPT, el Consorcio Internacional para Predecir el TEPT (ICPP) recopiló datos de 13 estudios de TEPT longitudinales basados en la atención aguda realizados en seis países diferentes.Objetivo: describir el enfoque del ICPP para la combinación de datos y la armonización, y presentar los resultados descriptivos entre estudios que informan el curso longitudinal del trastorno de estrés postraumático después del trauma agudo.Métodos: se recogieron datos a nivel de ítem de 13 estudios longitudinales de adultos sobrevivientes de trauma civil. Se identificaron y armonizaron constructos (por ejemplo, trastorno de estrés postraumático, depresión), medidas (preguntas o escalas) y variables de tiempo (días desde el trauma) y se recodificaron aquellas con codificación inconsistente (por ejemplo, educación, exposición de trauma a lo largo de la vida). Administrado en 11 estudios, la Escala de TEPT Administrada por el Clínico (CAPS) surgió como la principal medida del diagnóstico y la gravedad del TEPT.Resultados: el conjunto de datos agrupado incluyó 6254 sujetos (39,9% mujeres). La tasa promedio de retención de estudios fue 87.0% (rango: 49.1% a 93.5%). Las evaluaciones iniciales de los participantes se realizaron dentro de los dos meses posteriores a la exposición al trauma. Las duraciones de seguimiento variaron de 188 a 1110 días. Reflejando los criterios de inclusión de los estudios, la prevalencia de TEPT basal difirió significativamente entre los estudios (rango: 3,1% a 61,6%), y se observaron diferencias similares en las evaluaciones posteriores (respectivamente, 4,3% a 38,2% y 3,8% a 27,0% para la segunda y tercera evaluaciones).Conclusión: la agrupación de datos de los estudios recopilados de forma independiente requiere una cuidadosa conservación de los conjuntos de datos individuales para extraer y optimizar las comunalidades informativas. Sin embargo, es un paso importante hacia el desarrollo de un modelo de predicción robusto y generalizable para el TEPT y poder superar los hallazgos de estudios únicos. Las grandes diferencias en la prevalencia de TEPT advierten longitudinalmente contra el uso de cualquier estudio individual para inferir el resultado del trauma. La multiplicidad de instrumentos utilizados en estudios individuales enfatiza la necesidad de elementos de datos comunes en estudios futuros.背景：了解创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的发展是高效进行风险评估和制定预防计划的先决条件。 迄今为止的研究一直是针对特定地区和样本的。 旨在开发PTSD发展和预测的一般化模型，国际预防创伤后应激障碍联合会（ICPP）汇编了来自在六个不同国家进行的13项纵向急性护理PTSD研究的数据。目标：描述ICPP的数据汇集和同一的方法，并展示跨研究描述性结果，说明急性创伤后PTSD的纵向过程。方法：收集了13个成人平民创伤幸存者纵向研究的题目数据。 确定并统一了心理结构（如PTSD，抑郁），测量方式（问题或量表）和时间变量（创伤后天数），并对编码不一致的患者（例如教育，终身创伤暴露）进行重新编码。 在11项研究中，《临床使用的创伤后应激障碍量表（CAPS）》成为PTSD诊断和严重程度的主要指标。结果：汇总的数据集包括6254个受试者（39.9％的女性）。 研究的平均保留率为87.0％（范围：49.1％至93.5％）。 参与者的基线评估在创伤暴露的两个月内。 随访时间从188天到1110天不等。 研究的纳入标准、基线PTSD的患病率在研究间存在显着差异（范围：3.1％至61.6％），在随后的评估中存在类似的差异（第二和第三次评估范围分别为4.3％至38.2％，3.8％至27.0％）。结论：从独立收集的研究汇集数据需要仔细管理各个数据集以提取和优化信息共同性。 然而，这是发展PTSD有力且可推广的预测模型迈出的重要一步，并且可能超过单一研究结果的价值。 PTSD纵向患病率的巨大差异警告不能使用任何单一研究来推断创伤结果。 个别研究中使用的多种测量强调了未来研究中对共同数据元素的需求。.",132

Nevertheless, to date, no study using latent class or latent profile analysis (LCA/LPA) has examined patterns of co-occurring PTSD and depression symptoms among natural disaster survivors, nor has the distinctiveness of DSM-5 PTSD and depression symptoms been clarified in the aftermath of trauma. This study was primarily aimed at filling these gaps.LPA was used to examine self-reported PTSD and depression symptoms in an epidemiological sample of 1196 Chinese earthquake survivors.A 4-class solution characterized by low symptoms (53.9%), predominantly depression (18.2%), predominantly PTSD (18.9%) and combined PTSD-depression (9.0%) patterns fit the data best. Demographic characteristics and earthquake-related exposures were specifically or consistently associated with the non-parallel profiles varying in physical health impairment.A sample exposed to specific traumatic events was assessed by self-report measures.The distinctiveness of DSM-5 PTSD and depression symptoms following an earthquake suggests that PTSD and depression may be independent sequelae of psychological trauma rather than a manifestation of a single form of psychopathology. The current findings support the distinction between PTSD and depression constructs, and highlight the need for identifications of natural disaster survivors at high risk for PTSD and/or depression, and interventions individually tailored to one's symptom presentations.",133

The PCL is widely used in busy Department of Defense primary care settings as part of routine PTSD screening, requiring that it is easy for patients to complete and providers to score. The clinical utility of the PCL may be improved through use of a zero-anchored Likert-type response scale by providing intuitive anchors for respondents and fewer calculations for clinic staff; however, changes to the response scale may invalidate the known psychometric properties of the measure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the equivalence of a zero-anchored PCL to the traditional one-anchored PCL. Differences in total scores were examined using inferential confidence intervals. Substantial overlap of the inferential confidence intervals and small Rg (maximum probable difference) value of 0.68 indicated that the zero-anchored PCL is equivalent to the one-anchored PCL on the basis of our specified delta (amount of difference considered inconsequential). These findings support the use of a zero-anchored PCL in clinical practice, and more broadly, the use of zero-anchored measures in the larger field of psychological assessment.",134

Administering the CAPS is burdensome, requires skilled professionals, and relies on symptoms that are not fully expressed upon acute care admission. Predicting chronic PTSD from peritraumatic responses, which are obtainable upon acute care admission, has yielded conflicting results, hence the rationale for a stepwise screening-and-prediction practice. This work explores the ability of peritraumatic responses to produce risk likelihood estimates of early CAPS-based PTSD symptoms indicative of chronic PTSD risk. It specifically evaluates the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ) as a risk-likelihood estimator. Methods We used individual participant data (IPD) from five acute care studies that used both the PDEQ and the CAPS ( n = 647). Logistic regression calculated the probability of having CAPS scores ≥ 40 between 30 and 60 days after trauma exposure across the range of initial PDEQ scores, and evaluated the added contribution of age, sex, trauma type, and prior trauma exposure. Brier scores, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the mean slope of the calibration line evaluated the accuracy and precision of the predicted probabilities. Results Twenty percent of the sample had CAPS ≥ 40. PDEQ severity significantly predicted having CAPS ≥ 40 symptoms ( p &lt; 0.001). Incremental PDEQ scores produced a reliable estimator of CAPS ≥ 40 likelihood. An individual risk estimation tool incorporating PDEQ and other significant risk indicators is provided. Conclusion Peritraumatic reactions, measured here by the PDEQ, can reliably quantify the likelihood of acute PTSD symptoms predictive of chronic PTSD and requiring clinical attention. Using them as a screener in a stepwise chronic PTSD prediction strategy may reduce the burden of later CAPS-based assessments. Other peritraumatic metrics may perform similarly and their use requires similar validation. Trial registration Jerusalem Trauma Outreach and Prevention Study (J-TOPS): NCT00146900 .",135

Recent machine learning approaches have yielded insight into predicting PTSD symptom trajectories. Using data collected within 1 month of traumatic injury, we applied eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to classify admitted and discharged patients (hospitalized, n = 192; nonhospitalized, n = 214), recruited from a Level 1 trauma center, according to PTSD symptom trajectories. Trajectories were identified using latent class mixed models on PCL‐5 scores collected at baseline, 1–3 months posttrauma, and 6 months posttrauma. In both samples, nonremitting, remitting, and resilient PTSD symptom trajectories were identified. In the admitted patient sample, a unique delayed trajectory emerged. Machine learning classifiers (i.e., XGB) were developed and tested on the admitted patient sample and externally validated on the discharged sample with biological and clinical self‐report baseline variables as predictors. For external validation sets, prediction was fair for nonremitting versus other trajectories, areas under the curve (AUC = .70); good for nonremitting versus resilient trajectories, AUCs = .73–.76; and prediction failed for nonremitting versus remitting trajectories, AUCs = .46–.48. However, poor precision (&lt; .57) across all models suggests limited generalizability of nonremitting symptom trajectory prediction from admitted to discharged patient samples. Consistency in symptom trajectory identification across samples supports prior studies on the stability of PTSD symptom trajectories following trauma exposure; however, continued work and replication with larger samples are warranted to understand overlapping and unique predictive features of PTSD in different traumatic injury populations.",136

We assessed change in 9/11-related PTSD symptoms following cancer diagnosis in a 9/11-exposed cohort, the World Trade Center Health Registry.We examined enrollees who had a first-time post-9/11 invasive cancer diagnosis and at least one pre- and two post-diagnosis 9/11-related PTSD assessments from enrolment through 2015. PTSD symptoms were measured using 17-item PTSD Checklist (PCL, range 17-85). Cancer was identified from New York State Cancer Registry and categorized as localized or advanced stage. We used piecewise spline linear mixed-effects models to examine rate of change in PCL scores from pre- to post-diagnosis periods, and whether the change differed by gender or stage, with time as fixed and random effects, adjusting for baseline age, race, and education.9/11-related PTSD symptoms were slightly increasing in the pre-diagnosis period, while this trend reversed in the post-diagnosis period (β: -0.38; 95% CI: -0.60, -0.15). This trend was driven by male rescue/recovery workers (RRW), among whom significant decrease in rate of change in PCL scores was observed for those with advanced stage (slope change difference [95% CI]: -1.81 [-2.73, -0.90]). No significant difference in rate of change was observed among non-RRW.

Aim of the present four-wave study was to examine the cross-lagged relationships between CSE and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following PTEs in order to examine direction of influence. Levels of CSE and PTSD symptoms were measured with 4-month intervals. In addition, prospectively assessed personality traits and general self-efficacy perceptions as well as peritraumatic distress were entered in the analyses. The study sample consists of adult respondents of a representative internet panel who experienced PTE in the six months before T1, and did not experience any new PTE or life event between T1 and T3 (N = 400). Respondents were administered the coping self-efficacy scale (CSE-7), impact of event scale (IES) and arousal items of IES-R at each wave (T1 through T3), as well as questions on peritraumatic stress and prospectively measured personality traits (T0). Results of structural equation modeling showed that the effect of CSE on subsequent PTSD symptom levels was dominant. CSE significantly predicted subsequent symptoms, over and above earlier symptom levels, with higher CSE associated with lower PTSD. Symptoms in turn, did not predict subsequent levels of CSE. Higher peritraumatic distress was associated with both higher initial PTSD symptoms and lower initial CSE levels. Higher levels of the personality traits of emotional stability and agreeableness were associated with higher initial CSE levels. This supports a model in which CSE perceptions play an important role in recovery from trauma.",138

We used data from a 12-site randomized clinical trial that found PE to be more effective than PCT for reducing PTSD symptom severity.Participants were 284 female veterans and active duty soldiers with PTSD (M age = 44.8 years, range = 22-78; 45.4% non-White). Participants were randomized to 10 weekly sessions of PE or PCT and assessed before and after treatment and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The primary measure of PTSD symptoms and symptom clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal) was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Weathers et al., 2001) but we also assessed self-reported PTSD using the PTSD Checklist-Specific Version (PCL; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993).Almost all clinician-rated and self-reported symptoms improved from pre- to posttreatment in both conditions. In the analyses of clinician-rated PTSD, PE had greater benefit than PCT on avoidance and numbing clusters. PE also had greater benefit on most individual symptoms in these clusters as well as on distress related to reminders. In the analyses of self-reported PTSD, PE had greater benefit than PCT on all clusters and on most individual symptoms.PE may be especially helpful for individuals with significant avoidance and numbing.

The purpose of the interim analysis was to assess outcomes from the primary site, which is geographically, demographically, culturally, and procedurally distinct from the second site. Design: RCT was conducted within a Veterans Administration Health Care System. Data collection included preintervention through 3 months postintervention. Participants: Enrollment for the main site was 152 women. The sample size for the intent-to-treat analysis was 104. The majority were African American (91.3%) with a mean age of 48.46 years. Intervention: The TCTSY intervention (n = 58) was conducted by TCTSY-certified yoga facilitators and consisted of 10 weekly 60-min group sessions. The control intervention, cognitive processing therapy (CPT; n = 46), consisted of 12 90-min weekly group sessions conducted per Veterans Administration protocol by clinicians in the PTSD Clinic. Outcome measures: The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) was used to assess current PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity, including overall PTSD and four symptom clusters. The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to obtain self-report of PTSD symptom severity, including total score and four symptom clusters. Results: The findings reported here are interim results from one clinical site. For both the CAPS-5 and PCL-5, total scores and all four criterion scores decreased significantly (p < 0.01) over time in all five multilevel linear models within both TCTSY and CPT groups, without significant differences between groups. There were clinically meaningful improvements seen for both TCTSY and CPT with 51.1%-64.3% of TCTSY subjects and 43.5%-73.7% of CPT decreasing their CAPS-5 scores by 10 points or more. Effect sizes for total symptom severity were large for TCTSY (Cohen's d = 1.10-1.18) and CPT (Cohen's d = 0.90-1.40). Intervention completion was higher in TCTSY (60.3%) than in CPT (34.8%). Symptom improvement occurred earlier for TCTSY (midintervention) than for CPT (2 weeks postintervention). Safety: There were no unanticipated adverse events in this study. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that TCTSY may be an effective treatment for PTSD that yields symptom improvement more quickly, has higher retention than CPT, and has a sustained effect. TCTSY may be an effective alternative to trauma-focused therapy for women veterans with PTSD related to MST. The study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (CTR no.: NCT02640690).",141

Perceived life threat and assaultive trauma are consistent risk factors for subsequent PTSD development, although less work has explored them in combination. The current study evaluated whether trauma type (assaultive vs. nonassaultive) and perceived life threat, together, led to greater PTSD symptoms 1 month and 6 months postinjury.Participants included adult injured trauma survivors admitted to a level 1 trauma center. While hospitalized, perceived life threat during trauma was assessed and mechanism of injury was collected via record review and was collapsed into two categories: assaultive and nonassaultive. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fifth Edition]) was administered at 1 month (N = 137) and 6 months (N = 220) after injury.The four symptoms clusters of PTSD (intrusions, avoidance, hyperarousal, and negative mood/cognitions) were examined using four 2 (time) × 2 (life threat) × 2 (trauma type) mixed methods analyses of variance to assess differences based on risk factors and time. Results showed significant interaction effects of life threat, trauma type, and time for intrusive symptoms and avoidance symptoms. Individuals with life threat during assaultive traumas maintained heightened intrusive symptoms across time and increased avoidance at 6 months. On the other hand, participants with either life threat or assaultive traumas had decreased symptoms at 6 months.Experiencing assaultive trauma and life threat led to greater symptoms of PTSD. Individuals with assaultive traumas who experienced life threat may represent a specific at-risk group following injury. Avoidance can protract functional impairment and impede access to care, negatively impacting recovery.

Adaptive testing strategies can increase accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while decreasing patient and clinician burden.To develop and validate a computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity.A diagnostic study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019.The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5.Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r = 0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis (area under the curve = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r = 0.95 with a mean of only 10 adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden.Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The results suggest that scalable, valid, and rapid PTSD diagnostic screening and severity measurement are possible.",143

In addition, the construct validity of the ICD-11 CPTSD was assessed, and the ICD-11 and DSM-5 PTSD diagnoses among participants were compared.The sample consisted of 609 ACOAs. Participants filled out the PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5 (PCL-5), International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X), and the Children of Alcoholics Screening test (CAST-6).We observed many fewer PTSD cases when we followed the ICD-11 criteria compared to cases of PTSD diagnosed based on DSM-5 criteria among participants. In addition, latent profile analysis (LPA) did not provide evidence of the construct validity of CPTSD. Finally, we found heterogeneity of ACOAs sample in terms of PTSD/CPTSD profiles, which were differently related to their SWB.Further research is needed to establish to what extent CPTSD and PTSD are separate and discrete disorders and why such discrepancy in PTSD level is observed when we follow either DSM-5 or ICD-11. In addition, the person-centered approach may provide more insight than variable-centered methods and thus, undermine the ""uniformity myths"" about ACOAs.

In recent years, several trauma-focused therapies (TFTs), including cognitive restructuring (CR), prolonged exposure (PE), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) have been studied and found to be safe and effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in individuals with psychosis. However, studies were conducted in different countries, with varying inclusion criteria, therapy duration, control groups, and trial outcomes. RE.PROCESS will be the first study to compare the impact of CR, PE, and EMDR with a waiting list control condition within the same context.This is the protocol of a pragmatic, single-blind, multicentre, superiority randomized controlled trial, in which CR, PE, and EMDR are compared to a waiting list control condition for TFT (WL) in a naturalistic treatment setting. Inclusion criteria are as follows: age ≥ 16 years; meeting full DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), with a total CAPS score ≥ 23; and a psychotic disorder in the schizophrenia spectrum confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). Participants (N=200) will be randomly allocated to 16 sessions of one of the TFTs or WL, in addition to receiving treatment as usual (TAU) for psychosis. The primary objective is to compare the effects of CR, PE, and EMDR to WL on researcher-rated severity of PTSD symptoms over time from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Secondary objectives are to examine these effects at the separate time-points (i.e., mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up) and to test the effects for clinician-rated presence of PTSD diagnosis, and self-rated severity of (complex) PTSD symptoms.This is the first RCT to directly compare the effects of CR, PE, and EMDR within the same context to TAU on PTSD symptoms in individuals with psychosis and PTSD. Secondary effects on clinical and functional outcomes will be investigated both directly after therapy and long term.ISRCTN ISRCTN56150327 . Registered 18 June 2019.",145

Methods We analyzed data from a prospective mailed survey study of 396 adults living with MCC in southeastern Minnesota, USA. Participants completed a measure of treatment burden, the Patient Experience with Treatment and Self-management (PETS), and valid measures of health-related and psycho-social concepts at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. Latent class growth mixture modeling (LCGM) determined trajectories of treatment burden in two summary index scores of the PETS: Workload and Impact. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify independent predictors of the trajectories. Results LCGM supported a 2-class model for PETS Workload, including a group of consistently high workload ( N = 69) and a group of consistently low workload ( N = 311) over time. A 3-class model was supported for PETS Impact, including groups of consistently high impact ( N = 62), consistently low impact ( N = 278), and increasing impact ( N = 51) over time. Logistic regression analyses showed that the following factors were associated with patterns of consistently high or increasing treatment burden over time: lower health literacy, lower self-efficacy, more interpersonal challenges with others, and worse subjective reports of physical and mental health (all p &lt; .05). Conclusions Different longitudinal patterns of treatment burden exist among people with MCC. Raising health literacy, enhancing self-efficacy, and lessening the effects of negative social interactions might help reduce treatment burden.",146

In an expanded secondary analysis of a previous study, we sought to examine the comparative effectiveness of PE and CPT delivered in the naturalistic setting of an intensive treatment format including maintenance of outcomes through a 6-month follow-up period.A sample of 296 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) received either PE (n = 186) or CPT (n = 90), alongside other trauma-informed interventions, in a 2-week intensive clinical program. Treatment selection was determined collaboratively between patient and therapist. Our primary outcome was self-reported PTSD symptom severity (i.e., PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, PCL-5); secondarily, we examined self-reported depression (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire) symptom severity outcomes.A mixed-model regression controlling for age and gender revealed a significant effect of time from baseline to endpoint (p < .001), 3-month (p < .001), and 6-month follow-up (p < .001) on PCL-5 scores but no significant effect of treatment or effect of treatment by time interaction (all ps > .05; model: Wald's χ² = 232.38, p < .001). Results were similar for depression outcomes. Attrition at posttreatment was not significantly different between groups: 7.2% for CPT and 6.5% PE (z score = 0.22).Both PE and CPT are associated with comparable improvements when delivered as part of a 2-week intensive outpatient program.

After a clinical interview aimed at the collection of anamnestic data, CAPS to confirm the diagnosis of PTSD and DTS to assess frequency and severity of post-traumatic symptoms were administered. One-way ANOVA was used in order to compare the differences in the parameters analysed through the DTS scales and its clusters between the victims of terrorist attacks and patients undergone other traumatic events.The duration of PTSD was 258 +/ - 144.9 months for people who underwent a terrorist attack and 41.6 +/ - 11.8 months for victims of other traumatic events. As regards the severity of the disorder, the total score of the DTS scale was 65.6 +/ - 26.9 in victims of terrorist attacks and 78.2 +/ - 28.2 in people who undergone other traumatic events. However, the difference was not statistically significant; Avoidance and Hypervigilance clusters showed an important statistical significance.No significant differences are present in terms of severity, showing that PTSD is a disabling disorder regardless the type of event that triggers it; however, a significant difference in terms of duration of the disorder leads to reflec on the importance of an early diagnostic process aimed toward the victims of terrorism, in order to avoid the risk of chronicity and progression to other psychiatric disorders such as depression.",148

This study is part of a multi-center international collaborative research project that aims to provide psychometric support for this initial instrument in different languages, considering the specific contexts related to complex traumatization. This study verified the psychometric characteristics of the Portuguese version of the ITQ, evaluating symptoms beyond those described the existing literature. Methods: We examined the results of a convenience sample totaling 268 Portuguese and Angolan participants. Two instruments were applied: the ITQ, which evaluates symptoms resulting from a traumatic life event, and the Life Events Checklist (LEC), which evaluates stressful life events. The general characteristics of the scales are described, and reliability analysis and validity studies were performed. Results: Cronbach’s alpha varied between 0.84 and 0.88, and the exploratory factorial analysis results were consistent with the concept of C-PTSD, with five components explaining 61.58% of scale variance. Conclusion: The results suggest good psychometric characteristics for the Portuguese version of the ITQ, and thus it can be included in protocols intended evaluating complex traumatic symptoms.",150

We validated the Shona version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in a primary health care clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe. Adults aged 18 and above attending the clinic were enrolled over a two-week period in June 2016. After obtaining written consent, trained research assistants administered the tool to eligible participants. Study participants were then interviewed independently using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) as the gold standard by one of five doctors with training in mental health. A total of 204 participants were assessed. Of these, 91 (44.6%) were HIV positive, 100 (49%) were HIV negative, while 13 (6.4%) did not know their HIV status. PTSD was diagnosed in 40 (19.6%) participants using the gold standard procedure.

The International Trauma Interview (ITI) is a novel clinician-administered diagnostic interview for the assessment of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD.The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ITI in a Lithuanian sample in relation to interrater agreement, latent structure, internal reliability, as well as convergent and discriminant validity.In total, 103 adults with a history of various traumatic experiences participated in the study. The sample was predominantly female (83.5%), with a mean age of 32.64 years (SD = 9.36). For the assessment of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD, the ITI and the self-report International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) were used. Mental health indicators, such as depression, anxiety, and dissociation, were measured using self-report questionnaires. The latent structure of the ITI was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In order to test the convergent and discriminant validity of the ITI we conducted a structural equation model (SEM).Overall, based on the ITI, 18.4% of participants fulfilled diagnostic criteria for PTSD and 21.4% for CPTSD. A second-order two-factor CFA model of the ITI PTSD and disturbances in self-organization (DSO) symptoms demonstrated a good fit. The associations with various mental health indicators supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the ITI. The clinician-administered ITI and self-report ITQ had poor to moderate diagnostic agreement across different symptom clusters.The ITI is a reliable and valid tool for assessing and diagnosing ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD.Antecedentes: La 11ª revisión de la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades (CIE-11) incluye un nuevo diagnóstico de trastorno de estrés postraumático complejo (TEPT-C). La Entrevista Internacional de Trauma (ITI en su sigla en inglés) es una nueva entrevista diagnóstica administrada por un clínico para la evaluación del TEPT y el TEPT-C de la CIE-11.Objetivo: El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar las propiedades psicométricas de la ITI en una muestra lituana en relación con el acuerdo entre evaluadores, la estructura latente, la confiabilidad interna, así como la validez convergente y discriminante.Método: En total, participaron en el estudio 103 adultos con antecedentes de diversas experiencias traumáticas. La muestra fue predominantemente femenina (83.5%), con una edad media de 32.64 años (DE = 9.36). Para la evaluación del TEPT y TEPT-C de la CIE-11, se utilizaron la ITI y el Cuestionario Internacional de Trauma (ITQ en su sigla en inglés) de autoinforme. Los indicadores de salud mental, como la depresión, la ansiedad y la disociación, se midieron mediante cuestionarios de autoinforme. La estructura latente de la ITI se evaluó mediante análisis factorial confirmatorio (AFC). Para probar la validez convergente y discriminante de la ITI, llevamos a cabo un modelo de ecuaciones estructurales (SEM).Resultados: En general, según la ITI, el 18.4% de los participantes cumplió con los criterios diagnósticos de TEPT y el 21.4% de TEPT-C. El modelo AFC de dos factores de segundo orden de la ITI de TEPT y los síntomas de trastornos en la autoorganización (DSO) demostraron un buen ajuste. Las asociaciones con varios indicadores de salud mental apoyaron la validez convergente y discriminante de la ITI. La ITI administrada por un clínico y el ITQ autoinformado tuvieron una concordancia de diagnóstico pobre a moderada en diferentes grupos de síntomas.Conclusión: La ITI es una herramienta fiable y válida para evaluar y diagnosticar TEPT y TEPT-C según la CIE-11.背景:第 11 版国际疾病分类 (ICD-11) 纳入了对复杂性创伤后应激障碍 (CPTSD) 的新诊断。国际创伤访谈 (ITI) 是一种评估 ICD-11 PTSD 和 CPTSD的全新临床用诊断访谈。目的:本研究旨在评估立陶宛样本中 ITI与评分者之一致性, 潜在结构, 内部信度以及收敛效度和区分效度有关的心理测量学特性。方法:共有 103 名有各种创伤经历史的成年人参与了这项研究。样本主要为女性 (83.5%), 平均年龄为 32.64 岁 (SD = 9.36) 。对于 ICD-11 PTSD 和 CPTSD 的评估, 使用了 ITI 和自我报告的国际创伤问卷 (ITQ)。使用自我报告问卷测量心理健康指标, 如抑郁, 焦虑和解离。使用验证性因子分析 (CFA) 评估 ITI 的潜在结构。为了检验 ITI 的收敛和区分效度, 我们进行了结构方程模型 (SEM)。结果:总体而言, 根据 ITI, 18.4% 的参与者符合 PTSD 诊断标准, 21.4% 符合 CPTSD 诊断标准。 ITI PTSD 和自组织障碍 (DSO) 症状的二阶双因子 CFA 模型表现出良好的拟合。与各种心理健康指标的关联支持 ITI 的收敛效度和区分效度。临床用ITI 和自我报告的 ITQ 对不同症状群的有较差到中等的诊断一致性。结论:ITI 是评估和诊断 ICD-11 PTSD 和 CPTSD 的可靠且有效的工具.",152

Researchers and clinicians routinely use both measures in tandem to quantify symptom change, despite substantive instrumentation differences beyond administration modality, and absent a theoretical rationale or differential hypotheses for the two measures. The degree to which these measures provide comparable estimates of symptom change is unknown. This study examined concordance in change between CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores over time. Participants were male veterans (N = 198) randomly assigned to one of two group PTSD treatments. We administered both the CAPS-5 and PCL-5 at baseline, midtreatment, immediately posttreatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month posttreatment. Results indicated that CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores changed over time in a similar manner, as evidenced by generally parallel repeated-measures effect sizes, highly correlated slopes of change (r = .878), and similar associations with improvements in measures of depression and psychosocial functioning. However, the two measures did not produce identical estimates of symptom change. Estimates of symptom improvement were somewhat less concordant at posttreatment follow-up assessments; by the 12-month posttreatment assessment, changes in CAPS-5 scores from baseline indicated somewhat greater symptom improvement than changes in PCL-5 scores (CAPS-5 ESsg = -0.67, PCL-5 ESsg = -0.53). Collectively, results indicate that CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores produce similar but not identical estimates of PTSD symptom change. Thus, although PCL-5 scores closely approximate symptom change estimated by CAPS-5 scores, the two measures are not interchangeable. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",153

Parallels may be drawn to chronic illness and continuous traumatic situations (CTS) literature, which suggests unique symptom presentations that may occur during cumulative, ongoing traumas.Eighty-four adults completed the PTSD Checklist with appended questions evaluating pandemic index events, temporality of intrusive symptoms, self-appraised abnormality, and context dependence of symptoms. Using exploratory latent profile analysis, we modeled the latent structure of traumatic stress response to COVID-19 in order to evaluate possible nuanced patterns of symptoms differentiating PTSD from a transient ongoing trauma response.Two profiles broadly delineated by severity across all variables emerged, suggesting the framework of PTSD is apt when applied to COVID-19. However, secondary analyses revealed subtle signals supporting chronic illness and CTS frameworks. Specifically, some participants who met criteria for PTSD did not endorse index events meeting Criterion A, most endorsed intrusive symptoms related to a present or future threat (versus a past trauma), and 30% reported their symptoms to be context dependent.Results highlight a need for improved assessment and opportunities for treatment modification.

We utilized a convenience sample of 439 CSA survivors attending personalized psychotherapy treatment in Denmark. Four assessments were conducted on a six monthly basis over a period of 18 months. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to test solutions with one to six classes. Following this, a logistic regression was conducted to examine predictors of the identified trajectories. Results revealed four distinct trajectories which were labeled high PTSD gradual response, high PTSD treatment resistant, moderate PTSD rapid response, and moderate PTSD gradual response. Emotional and detached coping and more severe pretreatment avoidance and reexperiencing symptoms were associated with more severe and treatment resistant PTSD. High social support and a longer length of time since the abuse were associated with less severe PTSD which improved over time. The findings suggested that treatment response of PTSD in CSA survivors is characterized by distinct patterns with varying levels and rates of PTSD symptom improvement. Results revealed that social support is protective and that emotional and detached coping and high pretreatment levels of avoidance and reexperiencing symptoms are risk factors in relation to PTSD severity and course. These factors could potentially identify patients who are at risk of not responding to treatment. Furthermore, these factors could be specifically addressed to increase positive outcomes for treatment-seeking CSA survivors.",156

Latent growth curve modelling for parallel processes was used to simultaneously examine change in PCS and depressive symptoms over time and to evaluate the influence of one change process on the other.On average, patients enrolled 66 days following injury (Interquartile range (IQR) 43.5, 88.5). PCS and depressive symptoms were significantly associated at enrolment and over time, and both decreased over the course of 6 months.

However, research findings are inconsistent regarding the role of TR-shame in PTSD treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine if change in TR-shame predicted change in PTSD symptoms in treatment.A sample of 462 adults who received PTSD treatment at a Partial Hospitalization Program completed questionnaires measuring TR-shame (i.e., Trauma-Related Shame Inventory; TRSI) and PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5). Latent growth curve models were estimated to examine if the rate of change in TRSI predicted the rate of change in PCL-5 by using structural equation modeling. Furthermore, a latent regression model was estimated to predict the intercept and slope of the PCL-5.Model fits for the PCL-5 and the TRSI linear models were acceptable and both linear slopes were significant. On average, PCL-5 scores reduced 22.18 points from admission to discharge, while TRSI scores reduced 21.9 points from admission to discharge. The results of latent curve regression model suggested that the TRSI linear slope and intercept predicted the PCL-5 linear slope and intercept, respectively. Additionally, post-hoc analyses suggested that the variance in PCL-5 factors at discharge that were explained by TRSI intercept and linear slope ranged from 18.6% to 34.9%.The results of this study indicated that the rate of change in TR-shame predicted the rate of change in PTSD symptoms. Given the negative impact of TR-shame on PTSD symptoms, TR-shame should be a target in treatment for PTSD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",158

PTSD symptoms can be categorized into clusters including intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, each of which has been associated with distinct outcomes and treatment responses. Our objective was to determine which symptom cluster was predominant among surrogates of patients with CCI.Secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of a communication intervention.The original trial was conducted in medical intensive care units at three tertiary-care centers and one community hospital.Patients with CCI (≥7 d of mechanical ventilation and not expected to die or to be weaned from the ventilator in the subsequent 72 hr) and their surrogates.None.Surrogate PTSD symptoms were measured 90 days after onset of patient CCI using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). The IES-R includes a total score (range, 0-88, higher scores indicate severe symptoms) as well as three subscales that assess intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal (range of intrusion and avoidance scores 0-32 and range of hyperarousal score 0-24). Intrusion symptoms were most severe (mean score, 10.3; 95% CI, 9.3-11.2), followed by avoidance (mean score, 8.0; 95% CI, 7.2-8.8). Hyperarousal symptoms were lowest (mean score, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.5-5.7). In a multivariable linear regression model, we found that surrogates of patients who died had higher odds of intrusion (β, 5.52; p < 0.0001) and avoidance (β, 3.29; p = 0.001) symptoms than surrogates of patients who lived, even after adjusting for baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression. Patient death was not associated with hyperarousal symptoms.Intrusive thoughts are the most severe PTSD symptom in surrogates of patients experiencing CCI, with intensified symptoms among surrogates of patients who died. These results have the potential to inform tailored treatment strategies to reduce PTSD symptoms in this population.",160

Methods This study was an ED‐based prospective cohort study in an academic hospital. We included adult patients requiring acute intervention in the ED for resuscitation of a potentially life‐threatening medical emergency, defined as respiratory or cardiovascular instability. We measured patient‐perceived threat in the ED using a validated patient self‐assessment measure (score range = 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater perceived threat). We performed blinded assessment of PTSD symptoms 30 days after discharge using the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐Fifth Edition (PCL‐5). Results Ninety‐nine of 113 (88%) patients completed follow‐up, with 98% reporting some degree of perceived threat, median (interquartile range [IQR]) perceived threat score 12 (6 to 17), and 72% reported PTSD symptoms in relation to their ED visit (median [IQR] PCL‐5 score = 7 [0 to 30]). Patients with respiratory instability had higher median (IQR) perceived threat scores (16 [9 to 18] vs. 9 [6 to 14)] and PCL‐5 scores (10 [2 to 40] vs. 3 [0 to 17]) compared to patients without respiratory instability. In a multivariable linear regression model adjusting for potential confounders, greater perceived threat in the ED was independently associated with higher PCL‐5 scores (β = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.15 to 1.42). Among the individual perceived threat items, the feeling of helplessness during resuscitation had the strongest association with PCL‐5 score (β = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.29 to 8.18). Conclusions Perceived threat during potentially life‐threatening emergencies is common and independently associated with development of PTSD symptoms. Additional research to test whether reduction of perceived threat in the ED attenuates the development of PTSD symptoms following potentially life‐threatening emergencies is warranted.",161

PICS and PTSD affect both ICU survivors and their families, which overburdens the healthcare systems. Lack of evidence on the comparative psychometric properties of assessment tools is a major barrier in evidence-based screening for post-ICU symptomatology and health-related quality of life.We aimed to identify existing tools for screening PTSD and PICS in ICU survivors and their families and to examine evidence on the validity, reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of existing tools, as reflected in published peer-reviewed studies.A scoping review based on literature searches (CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Dissertations and Theses Global, and Google Scholar) and predefined eligibility criteria was conducted according to current scoping review guidelines.We identified 44 studies reporting on the development and assessment of psychometric properties of PICS/PTSD in ICU survivors or families globally. We identified five tools addressing all three aspects of PICS manifestations, one tool for both physical and mental aspects of PICS, and fivefive tools for quality-of-life assessment in ICU survivors. Altogether, 25 tools assess only one aspect of PICS: five for cognitive impairment, seven for physical impairment, and 13 for mental health impairment and PTSD in ICU survivors. However, only two tools were found for PICS-family assessment. Other findings include (i) unclear validity and often limited feasibility of tools, (ii) low diagnostic accuracy of cognitive assessment tools, and (iii) evidence of appropriate psychometric properties and feasibility of psychological health assessment tools.These results have implications for the selection and implementation of the assessment methods as a means for promoting meaningful patient-centred clinical outcomes to minimise long-term sequelae, reduce the rate of rehospitalisation, and optimise recovery after ICU discharge.",162

The participating women ( N = 469), who gave birth with emergency and elective CS at the Greek University Hospital of Larisa, have consented to participate in two phases of the survey and completed self-report questionnaires, the 2 nd day after CS and at the 6 th week after CS. Measures used in this study were the PCL-5 for DSM-5, the Life Events Checklist (LEC-5), Criteria B, C, D, E, and Criterion A, specifically designed for detection of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in postpartum period. To evaluate the internal reliability of the PCL-5 two different indices of internal consistency were calculated, i.e., Cronbach’s alpha (.97) and Guttman’ssplit-half (.95), demonstrating high reliability level. The data were positively skewed, suggesting that the reported levels of PTSD among our participants were low. Factor analyses demonstrated acceptable construct validity; a comparison of thePCL-5 with the other measures of the same concept showed a good convergent validity of the scale. Overall, all the results suggest that the four-factor PCL-5 seemed to work adequately for the Greek sample of women after CS.",163

In the current global context instead of four clusters of symptoms in previous DSM, DSM-5 also have fifth. It included claster with negative alterations in mood and cognition. These changes were triggered by the views of experts in the field of cognitive-behavioral therapy - basic scientific proven treatment of posttraumatic stress. Scales for assessing PTSD - CAPS-5 (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5) and PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5) also have changed. Due to the high relevance of timely diagnosis and assessment of PTSD in Ukraine there is a need for translation and adaptation of scales for use in Ukrainian population.Currently we have translated and adapted these scales provided by the National Center for PTSD in the United States (National Center for PTSD). Reliability and validity CAPS-5 and PCL-5 assessed in the study effectiveness of short-term cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD.

Siblings (N = 229; 42% of eligible/approached; 53% identifying as female; 68% identifying as non-Hispanic White) completed the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale. Caregivers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and growth mixture modeling (GMM) identified PTSS patterns across time.Fit statistics supported models with three to five PTSS trajectories. The three-class LCGA model included a large mild PTSS group (61%), a moderate PTSS group (35%), and a small (4%) stable severe PTSS group. The four-class LCGA and three- and four-class GMM included groups improving from moderate to mild PTSS (7-21%) and worsening to moderate PTSS across time (12-17%). Across models, siblings with mild PTSS had fewer caregiver-reported emotional and behavioral difficulties on the SDQ.A large group of siblings of children with cancer demonstrate resiliency, however, substantial subsets experience patterns of PTSS that include levels in the moderate-to-severe range during the first two years post-diagnosis. Future research should examine these patterns in more diverse/representative samples and identify factors associated with increasing and sustained severe PTSS to inform intervention targets and reduce cancer-related burden on families.",165

This study sought out to explore the factor structure and reliability of the Portuguese version of the PCL-M. A sample of 660 Portuguese Colonial War Veterans completed the PCL-M. Several Confirmatory Factor Analyses were conducted to test different structures for PCL-M PTSD symptoms. Although the respecified first-order four-factor model based on King et al.׳s model showed the best fit to the data, the respecified first and second-order models based on the DSM-IV symptom clusters also presented an acceptable fit. In addition, the PCL-M showed adequate reliability. The Portuguese version of the PCL-M is thus a valid and reliable measure to assess the severity of PTSD symptoms as described in DSM-IV. Its use with Portuguese Colonial War Veterans may ease screening of possible PTSD cases, promote more suitable treatment planning, and enable monitoring of therapeutic outcomes.",166

We used data from three independent samples of male military veterans, including two randomized controlled trials for PTSD (N = 198 for Sample 1 and N = 102 for Sample 2) and a cross-sectional study of primary care patients (N = 228). For Sample 1, within-person change in CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores of ≥ 13 and 15, respectively, was indicative of reliable change. For Sample 2, within-person change in CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores of ≥ 12 and 18, respectively, was indicative of reliable change. Scores of ≤ 8 and 28 on the CAPS-5 and PCL-5, respectively, indicated a participant is more likely to belong to the non-PTSD population than the PTSD population (i.e., clinically significant change) in both Samples 1 and 2. Participants who exhibited reliable or CSC reported significantly better psychosocial functioning at all posttreatment assessments than those who did not. Results provide thresholds for identifying clinically meaningful PTSD symptom change using these measures. Care should be taken to interpret these values appropriately and relative to numerous other definitions for meaningful symptom change.

It is unknown which psychological assessment tools are most appropriate to evaluate psychological distress in this population. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate existing assessment tools used to measure psychological distress with emphasis on citizen responders who attempted resuscitation. Methods A systematic literature search conducted by two reviewers was carried out in March 2018 and revised in July 2018. Four databases were searched: PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and The Social Sciences Citation Index. A total of 504 studies examining assessment tools to measure psychological distress reactions after acute traumatic events were identified, and 9 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for further analysis. The selected studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Results The Impact of Event Scale (IES) and The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were the preferred assessment tools, and were used on diverse populations exposed to various traumatic events. One study included lay rescuers performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and this study used the IES. The IES and the IES-R also have proven a high validity in various other populations. The Clinical administered PTSD scale (CAPS) was applied in two studies. Though the CAPS is comparable to both the IES-R and the IES, the CAPS assess PTSD symptoms in general and not in relation to a specific experienced event, which makes the scale less suitable when measuring stress due to a specific resuscitation attempt. Conclusions The IES and the IES-R seem to be solid measures for psychological distress among people experiencing an acute psychological traumatic event. However, only one study has assessed psychological distress among citizen responders in OHCA for which the IES-R scale was used, and therefore, further research on this topic is warranted.",169

Validation within a civilian sample will increase the generalizability of the PC-PTSD-5 as a brief screening measure to identify PTSD within primary care practices.The present study is a retrospective review of data (N = 198) collected as part of a patient registry for an integrated behavioral health consultation service within a primary care clinic. The PC-PTSD-5 was administered as part of a standardized set of brief screening measures and a standard clinical interview. Diagnostic validation was accomplished via a consensus model between a board-certified family medicine physician and a licensed psychologist along with medical/psychology trainees.Fifty-two participants (26.26%) out of 198 who completed the PC-PTSD-5 were diagnosed with PTSD. The PC-PTSD-5 demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve = 0.933, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.901-0.965). A cutoff score of 4 maximized sensitivity (sensitivity% = 100) while maintaining acceptable specificity (specificity% = 85.2).

Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD severity, depression, borderline symptom severity, behavior problems, and dissociation.Of the 44 participants who received D-CPT, 28 (63 %) responded and were assessed at 6-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 22 participants (50 %) responded. The majority of participants in the WL/TA group received D-CPT after the end of the trial and were hence not available for follow-up assessment. In the D-CPT group, treatment gains were maintained at 6- and 12-month follow-up in the CAPS-CA as well as in all secondary outcomes.The positive effects of D-CPT were stable in adolescents and young adults with abuse-related PTSD indicating that they can benefit in the long term from a treatment with D-CPT.",171

We evaluated whether PTSD symptoms predicted future physical functioning and vice versa using five assessments over four years. Data was used from a longitudinal cohort of 695 participants recruited from Veteran Affairs medical outpatient clinics who experienced a traumatic event. PTSD symptom severity was assessed annually with the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Physical functioning was measured with the 10-item subscale of the SF-36. An autoregressive cross-lagged panel model was used to determine the temporal associations between PTSD and physical functioning, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education and employment. Comorbidities and health behaviors were added to assess their roles in the relationship. Greater PTSD symptom severity predicted worse physical functioning the following year (average β = –0.10, P <0.001), where a 10-point increase in PCL score predicted a 0.3-point decline in physical function score over one year. Similarly, better physical functioning also predicted reduced PTSD severity the following year, but to a smaller magnitude (average β = –0.04, P = .003). The pattern of effects was similar after controlling for comorbidities and health behaviors. Both primary variables relied on self-report, and generalizability may be limited by the mostly male Veteran sample. Our results support a bidirectional, but unequal, relationship between PTSD and physical functioning over time. They also highlight the importance of long-term control of PTSD symptoms in preventing functional decline.",172

Methods Ten adolescents meeting full diagnostic criteria for PTSD were recruited from a specialized outpatient mental health clinic and offered a standardized intensive PE . The intensive PE consisted of three daily 90‐min exposure sessions delivered on five consecutive weekdays, followed by 3 weekly 90‐min booster sessions. In a single‐trial design, the participants were randomly allocated to one of five baseline lengths (4–8 weeks) before starting the intensive PE . Before, during, and after intensive PE completion, self‐reported PTSD symptom severity was assessed weekly as a primary outcome (a total of 21 measurements). Furthermore, clinician‐administered PTSD diagnostic status and symptom severity (primary outcome), as well as self‐reported comorbid symptoms (secondary outcomes), were assessed at four single time points (baseline‐to‐6‐month follow‐up). Results Time‐series analyses showed that self‐reported PTSD symptom severity significantly declined following treatment ( p = .002). Pre‐postgroup analyses demonstrated significant reductions of clinician‐administered PTSD symptom severity and self‐reported comorbidity that persisted during the 3‐ and 6‐month follow‐ups (all ps &lt; .05), where 80% of adolescents had reached diagnostic remission of PTSD . There was neither treatment dropout nor any adverse events. Conclusions The results of this first proof of concept trial suggest that intensive PE can be effective and safe in an adolescent population with complex PTSD , although the gains achieved need to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.",173

We hypothesized that circadian rhythm changes, measured by a wrist-worn research watch are predictive of post-trauma outcomes.1618 post-trauma patients were enrolled after admission to emergency departments (ED). Three standardized questionnaires were administered at week eight to measure post-trauma outcomes related to PTSD, sleep disturbance, and pain interference with daily life. Pulse activity and movement data were captured from a research watch for eight weeks. Standard and novel movement and cardiovascular metrics that reflect circadian rhythms were derived using this data. These features were used to train different classifiers to predict the three outcomes derived from week-eight surveys. Clinical surveys administered at ED were also used as features in the baseline models.The highest cross-validated performance of research watch-based features was achieved for classifying participants with pain interference by a logistic regression model, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70. The ED survey-based model achieved an AUC of 0.77, and the fusion of research watch and ED survey metrics improved the AUC to 0.79.This work represents the first attempt to predict and classify post-trauma symptoms from passive wearable data using machine learning approaches that leverage the circadian desynchrony in a potential PTSD population.",175

Some patients will subsequently develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) while other will not. The problem is under-diagnosed in EDs and no standardized management is provided to prevent PTSD. Most studies focused on a particular group of trauma whereas we need a global approach to further develop interventions for detecting and treating patients at high risk. We aim to assess the prevalence of traumatic exposure and situation at high risk of further PTSD and identify pre and peri-traumatic biopsychosocial factors predisposing individuals to PTSD in the general context of EDs. This comprehensive multicenter study will have two steps. The first step will be a cross-sectional study on moderate and high risk of PTSD prevalence among EDs visitors with a recent history of trauma. All patients aged 18–70 years, presenting with a recent history of trauma (< 1 month) in one of the six EDs in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region (≈1/10° of the French population) will be included over a 1-month period and approximately 1500 subjects are expected in this cross-sectional step. The risk of PTSD will be assessed using the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R). Self-administered questionnaires will be used to measure acute stress (IES–R), and a number of potential bio-psycho-social risk factors. Demographic and physical health-related data will be collected from medical file. Second step will be a prospective cohort study within a sub-sample of 400 patients enrolled in step 1, randomly selected with stratification on sex, age, ED, and IES–R score. At 3 months, PTSD will be defined by a ≥ 33 score at PTSD Check List for DSM–5 (PCL–5) through a telephone interview. We will evaluate definite PTSD biopsychosocial predictive factors using a multivariate logistic regression model and describe evolution of PTSD at 3 months. This is the first study to assess PTSD predictors prospectively with a biopsychosocial approach within a cohort representative of EDs visitors. The results will inform the development of dedicated interventions to decrease the risk of subsequent PTSD.

Participants comprised trauma-exposed Chinese and Pakistani undergraduate students ( N = 495 and N = 186, respectively). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that a seven-factor hybrid model involving intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing behaviors, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal factors provided good fit in both samples. This model fit significantly better than three alternative models including the DSM-5 four-factor model and six-factor anhedonia and externalizing behaviors models. The subsequent multigroup CFA showed that the best-fitting hybrid model demonstrated cross-cultural measurement invariance. Our findings provide further empirical support for the seven-factor PTSD hybrid model and its cross-cultural invariance, and have implications for understanding and application of DSM-5 's PTSD symptoms.",178

The EGEP was designed as a self-report measure aimed to assess posttraumatic symptoms, providing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria and also symptoms severity scores. It includes all the PTSD diagnostic criteria, and other posttraumatic symptoms, such as negative cognition, dissociation or blame. EGEP was validated in a sample of 175 victims of diff erent traumatic events. Results showed that EGEP provides reliable and valid information: internal consistency (α = 0.92) and item analyses were satisfactory; confi rmatory factor analysis showed good fi t of model for the DMS-IV criteria; and diagnostic performance when compared with CIDI was adequate (sensitivity 91% and specificity 75%). All in all, the EGEP provides complete information for the assessment of trauma and PTSD in a brief self-report format that could be useful in clinical and research settings and that has been validated in Spanish populations.",179

We examined the criterion validity of PCL-5 separately for each of its 20 items by comparing scores of patients injured in high impact motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) to scores of persons in a control group. In addition, we evaluated criterion and convergent validity of the PCL-5 total scores.&#x0D; Method: De-identified data of 80 post-MVA patients (mean age 38.9 years, SD=12.8) included their scores on the PCL-5, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Rivermead Post-concussion Symptoms Questionnaire, Subjective Neuropsychological Symptoms Scale (SNPSS), ratings of depression, anger, and anxiety (Items 10 to 12 of the Whiplash Disability Questionnaire), and three questionnaire measures of driving anxiety (Steiner’s, Whetstone’s, and DAQ). The patients were assessed, on the average, 49.7 weeks (SD=36.3) after their MVA, but all still experienced active post-MVA symptoms requiring therapy.&#x0D; The PCL-5 scores were also available from 21 controls (mean age 43.0 years, SD=20.3).&#x0D; Results and Discussion: With respect to criterion validity of the PCL-5, the post-MVA patients differed significantly from the control group not only with respect to their total PCL-5 scores, but also on all 20 individual items of the PCL-5, and also on all 4 subscales of PCL-5 (Intrusion, Avoidance, Altered Cognitions/Mood, and Arousal). The PCL-5 total scores correlated significantly to all three measures of post-MVA driving anxiety, post-MVA pain and insomnia, post-MVA depression, anger, and generalized anxiety, and to post-MVA subjective neuropsychological symptoms in the post-concussion and whiplash spectrum.&#x0D; Conclusions: Both the criterion and convergent validity of the PCL-5 for the use on post-MVA patients are excellent.",180

This study assessed the ability of a classification-independent measure of posttraumatic stress symptoms, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (Weiss & Marmar, 1996), to capture the ICD-11 model of PTSD. The current study also provided the first assessment of the predictive validity of ICD-11 PTSD. Former East German political prisoners were assessed in 1994 (N = 144) and in 2008-2009 (N = 88) on numerous psychological variables using self-report measures. Of the participants, 48.2% and 36.8% met probable diagnosis for ICD-11 PTSD at the first and second assessments, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the factorial validity of the 3-factor ICD-11 model of PTSD, as represented by items selected from the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis demonstrated that, controlling for sex, the symptom clusters of ICD-11 PTSD (reexperiencing, avoidance, and sense of threat) significantly contributed to the explanation of depression (R2 = .17), quality of life (R2 = .21), internalized anger (R2 = .10), externalized anger (R2 = .12), hatred of perpetrators (R2 = .15), dysfunctional disclosure (R2 = .27), and social acknowledgment as a victim (R2 = .12) across the 15-year study period. Current findings add support for the factorial and predictive validity of ICD-11 PTSD within a unique cohort of political prisoners.",181

Identification of individuals with PTSS risk in the early aftermath of TSE is important to enable targeted administration of preventive interventions. In this study, we used baseline survey data from two prospective cohort studies to identify the most influential predictors of substantial PTSS. Methods Self-identifying black and white American women and men ( n = 1546) presenting to one of 16 emergency departments (EDs) within 24 h of motor vehicle collision (MVC) TSE were enrolled. Individuals with substantial PTSS (⩾33, Impact of Events Scale – Revised) 6 months after MVC were identified via follow-up questionnaire. Sociodemographic, pain, general health, event, and psychological/cognitive characteristics were collected in the ED and used in prediction modeling. Ensemble learning methods and Monte Carlo cross-validation were used for feature selection and to determine prediction accuracy. External validation was performed on a hold-out sample (30% of total sample). Results Twenty-five percent ( n = 394) of individuals reported PTSS 6 months following MVC. Regularized linear regression was the top performing learning method. The top 30 factors together showed good reliability in predicting PTSS in the external sample (Area under the curve = 0.79 ± 0.002). Top predictors included acute pain severity, recovery expectations, socioeconomic status, self-reported race, and psychological symptoms. Conclusions These analyses add to a growing literature indicating that influential predictors of PTSS can be identified and risk for future PTSS estimated from characteristics easily available/assessable at the time of ED presentation following TSE.",183

However, the course of PTSD after sexual assault has not been summarized. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify the prevalence and severity of PTSD and changes to the average rate of recovery in the 12 months following sexual assault.Authors searched four databases for prospective studies published before April 2020 and sought relevant unpublished data. Eligible studies assessed PTSD in at least 10 survivors of sexual assault in at least two time points, starting within 3 months postassault. Random effects linear-linear piecewise models were used to identify changes in average recovery rate and produce model-implied estimates of monthly point prevalence and mean symptom severity.Meta-analysis of 22 unique samples (N = 2,106) indicated that 74.58% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [67.21, 81.29]) and 41.49% (95% CI: [32.36, 50.92]) of individuals met diagnostic criteria for PTSD at the first and 12th month following sexual assault, respectively. PTSD symptom severity was 47.94% (95% CI: [41.27, 54.61]) and 29.91% (95% CI: [23.10, 36.73]) of scales' maximum severity at the first and 12th month following sexual assault, respectively. Most symptom recovery occurred within the first 3 months following sexual assault, after which point the average rate of recovery slowed.Findings indicate that PTSD is common and severe following sexual assault, and the first 3 months postassault may be a critical period for natural recovery.",184

The present study is the first to test the factorial structure and measurement invariance of the HTQ according to DSM-5 criteria across gender and ethnic groups in the ethnically diverse society of post-conflict Sri Lanka. The survey sample included 5136 participants (86% response rate) followed up 12 months after a baseline nationally representative survey undertaken in Sri Lanka in 2014. Exposure to conflict-related traumatic experiences (TEs) generating a trauma count (TC), and symptoms of PTSD were assessed using a modified version of the HTQ adapted to the local context. The final analytic sample included 4260 participants after excluding records with missing data on key variables. We conducted Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MG-CFA) to test the four-factor (DSM-5 consistent) and three-factor (DSM-IV-TR) models of PTSD, then assessing measurement invariance of the four factor model by gender and ethnic groups. The three-factor and four-factor DSM-5 model each produced a good fit across the sample as a whole. In addition, there was configural, metric, and scalar invariance for the four-factor model both by gender and ethnicity. The trauma count was directly associated with each of the symptom domains of the four factor model. Our findings provide support for the capacity of the modified HTQ to measure the DSM5 construct of PTSD across gender and key ethnic groupings in Sri Lanka. Confirmation of our findings in other cultures will be important.",185

Secondary aim was to compare levels of the outcome with injury severity and specialization level of two trauma centres.A retrospective study included patients received by the trauma response teams at two hospitals in 2013 aged 18 or more at follow-up. We assessed QoL and PTSD with one mailed questionnaire to each patient at either 12 or 24 months of follow-up. Health status was measured by EuroQol EQ-5D and the Glasgow Outcome Scale. PTSD symptoms were classified according to the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV).A questionnaire was mailed to 774 patients at end of 2014 or early 2015, 455 were included for analysis; median age 44 (IQR 25-57; 68% male); median NISS 9 (IQR 2-17); At follow-up 24% (95% CI 20-28) reported a EQ index score value equivalent to the lowest 2.3% in the Danish population norm. Probable PTSD was present in 19% (95% CI 13-27) of patients with severe injuries (NISS> 15), and 23% (95% CI 19-28) of those with NISS < 15.Severe trauma has substantial impact on QoL and PTSD assessed at 12-24 months after the trauma. The QoL was well below the Danish population norm. The presence of PTSD was independent of injury severity. Trauma Centres should consider to include this as part of the treatment principles.",186

This study explored how EI patients experience posttraumatic stress using the 3 symptom-cluster subscales from the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Method Cross-sectional analyses measured PTSD symptom severity and frequency using the PCL-C among 19 adult EI patients referred for neuropsychological evaluation. The sample was 79% male, 68.4% Caucasian, 15.8% African American, 15.8% Hispanic, with mean age of 46.3 years (SD = 8.45) and mean education of 12.3 years (SD = 2.6). Results Mean PCL-C total score was 54.3 (SD = 12.4, range: 31–76). Fifteen participants had total scores exceeding the recommended cut-score of ≥44, indicating that they met criteria for presumptive PTSD diagnoses. On average, Cluster D (hyperarousal) symptoms were the most severe (M = 3.5/5) followed by Cluster C (avoidance/numbing) (M = 3.3/5) and Cluster B (re-experiencing) (M = 2.8/5). The most frequently endorsed symptoms were loss of pleasure (84%), sleep disturbance (84%), and difficulty concentrating (84%), which also were the most severe symptoms (M = 4.0/5; M = 3.9/5; M = 4.0/5, respectively). The two symptoms endorsed least often were repeated disturbing dreams of the stressful experience (42%) and reexperiencing the traumatic event (37%), and they were also the least severe (M = 2.6/5; M = 2.3/5, respectively). Conclusions In EI patients, general symptoms of psychological distress were more prominent than more prototypical trauma-related symptoms (e.g., re-experiencing, intrusive thoughts). Future research should examine if these symptoms of distress are unique to EI patients’ experiences of posttraumatic stress compared to other clinical populations.",187

The present study explored the potential for physiological assessment to aid in defining and validating screening criteria for the presence of significant PTSD-related symptoms in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans seeking care in a VA post-deployment health clinic. Heart rate reactivity scores during the imagining phase of the script-driven imagery paradigm were compared across groups of individuals with and without probable PTSD diagnoses, as defined by PCL-IV cutoff scores ranging from 40 to 60. Significant differences were found for groups defined by PCL-IV cutoff scores of 50 and 60, with 50 producing the largest effect size. Diagnosing PTSD is made challenging by the presence of overlapping symptoms shared with other diagnoses, as well as by the necessity for patients to accurately report their symptoms. An objective physiological measure capable of accurately differentiating individuals with and without PTSD provides potential adjunctive diagnostic and treatment information to clinicians. The present findings support the validity of physiological reactivity during SDI as a NIMH RDoC measure that can be used in research and clinical applications assessing trauma-related symptom severity.",188

Trauma survivorship has grown rapidly, while defining the factors that influence posttraumatic QoL has lagged. This study sought to develop a valid and reliable trauma-specific QoL measure to help guide future posttraumatic research and clinical care.Qualitative data were collected from adult trauma patients and their caregivers (Phase 1). Subsequent analysis of these data resulted in the development of a 59-item QoL questionnaire. The 59-item trauma-specific QoL (T-QoL) questionnaire was then administered to adult trauma patients (n = 394), and a factor analysis was conducted. The validity of the final T-QoL measurement tool was assessed (n = 111) using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) (Phase 2).A five-component structure using 43 items seemed to best represent the data. The five components included emotional well-being, functional engagement, recovery/resilience, peritraumatic experience, and physical well-being. Four of the five components were found to have strong Cronbach's α scores (>0.7), demonstrating consistent interitem reliability. All subscales of the T-QoL correlated negatively with the PCL-C (p < 0.01), demonstrating that as the T-QoL increases, the likelihood of PTSD decreases. The physical well-being subscale of the T-QoL correlated significantly with the SF-36v2 physical component score, as did the emotional well-being subscale with the SF-36v2 mental component score (p < 0.05).This study used the experiences of trauma victims and their informal caregivers to develop a five-component, 43-item questionnaire with domains that are unique to trauma populations. Its accuracy and validity were confirmed using the PCL-C and the SF-36v2. We believe that the T-QoL represents a novel tool that can be used by trauma professionals to positively impact research efforts and clinical care.Prognostic study, level II.",189

Research suggests that survivors of traumatic events frequently compare their current well-being to different standards. Yet, our understanding of the role of comparative thinking in well-being is limited to a few cross-sectional studies. We therefore examined the temporal relationship between aversive well-being comparisons (i.e., comparisons threatening self-motives), PTSD symptoms, and life satisfaction in individuals with a trauma history. Method: A sample of 518 participants with exposure to traumatic events was administered measures of PTSD, life satisfaction, and the Comparison Standards Scale for Well-being (CSS-W) at two timepoints, three months apart. The CSS-W assessed the frequency, perceived discrepancy, and affective impact of aversive social, temporal, counterfactual, and criteria-based comparisons related to well-being. Results: Comparison frequency emerged as significant predictor of PTSD symptoms, beyond baseline PTSD levels. Life satisfaction contributed unique variance to the comparison process by predicting comparison frequency, discrepancy, and affective impact. The findings suggest that frequent aversive comparisons may lead to a persistent focus on negative aspects of well-being, thereby exacerbating PTSD symptoms. They further indicate that comparison frequency, discrepancy, and affective impact are significantly influenced by life-satisfaction. Conclusions: Altogether, the findings support the need for a thorough examination of the role of comparative behavior in clinical populations, which may ultimately help improve clinical care.",191

CPTSD is linked to earlier, prolonged interpersonal trauma, and is characterized by a broader range of symptoms, in addition to the core PTSD symptoms. The International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) has been developed to assess the new diagnostic criteria.Objectives: The primary aim of our study was to test the factor structure of the ITQ in a clinical and a non-clinical Hungarian sample. We also examined whether the degree of traumatization or the type of trauma experienced was associated with meeting the criteria for PTSD or CPTSD, or with the severity of PTSD or disturbances in self-organization (DSO) symptoms, in both samples.Method: A trauma-exposed heterogeneous clinical sample (N = 176) and a non-clinical sample (N = 229) filled out the ITQ and a modified version of the Life Events Checklist (LEC-5). The factor structure of the ITQ was tested by examining the model fit of seven competing confirmatory factor analysis models.Results: A two-factor second-order model with a second-order PTSD factor (measured by three first-order factors) and a DSO factor (measured directly by six symptoms) had the best fit to the data in both samples if an error correlation was allowed between negative self-concept items. Those in the clinical group who reported more interpersonal and childhood trauma experienced more PTSD and DSO symptoms. Also, there were significant, positive, and weak associations between the total number of different traumas and PTSD and DSO factor scores in both samples.Conclusion: ITQ was found to be a reliable tool to differentiate between PTSD and CPTSD, two related but distinct constructs in a clinical and a non-clinical trauma-exposed sample in Hungary.The distinction between PTSD and DSO as related but separate constructs was validated using the ITQ in a Hungarian clinical and non-clinical sample.CPTSD was more frequent than PTSD among general help-seeking clinical clients, while in the non-clinical sample PTSD had a higher prevalence rate.Interpersonal trauma in childhood and adulthood was associated with more PTSD and DSO symptoms.",192

The present study investigates the psychometric properties of the Turkish Version of the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), the first scale developed for PTSD and CPTSD diagnosis purposes. The sample for this study comprised 395 participants recruited from the clinical sample (n = 112) and community (n = 283). After identifying the best fitting model, correlations between factors and criterion variables were calculated to examine the concurrent and convergent validity of ITQ scales. Criterion variables to examine concurrent validity comprised PTSD symptoms as assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), The Core Self-Evaluations Scale (CSES), Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS), and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Participants were primarily female (61.0%, n = 241) with a mean age of 32.43 years (SD = 10.14).

We examined the course of PTSD symptoms during the first year after aSAH. In this prospective cohort study, the Impact of Event Scale (IES) was applied in 128 patients 3, 6 and 12 months after aSAH. Multilevel modelling was used to assess changes in levels of PTSD symptoms over time and to explore if demographic characteristics, aSAH characteristics, level of education, cognitive functioning and neuroticism are associated to the course of PTSD symptoms. Multilevel analyses showed at group level no differences in the average level of PTSD symptoms between 3, 6 of 12 months post-aSAH (p = 0.22). At individual level, changes in PTSD symptoms over time were present (X2 (121) = 149.73 p = 0.04). None of the factors could explain the variance in change of PTSD symptoms over time. The course of PTSD appears to differ between individuals after aSAH. We found no factors that explain these differences. There is not one optimal moment in time to assess PTSD.

The combination of severe insomnia, avoidance, and hyper-vigilance may be key symptoms for comorbidity of PTSD and MDD. Future studies should focus on these symptoms to better target people at high risk for developing PTSD or MDD.",198

A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial was used to determine if providing psychotherapy for PTSD via videoconference (VC) is as effective as in-person (IP) psychotherapy. Methods All eligible veterans ( n = 207) received cognitive processing therapy (CPT) to treat PTSD symptoms in one of the two treatment modalities. Participant symptoms were collected at baseline, post-treatment, and six months after treatment completion. The primary outcome measure, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), was used to assess PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity. Secondary outcomes included two self-report measures of symptom severity, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist – Specific (PCL–S) for PTSD and the Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 (PHQ–9) for depressive symptoms. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess non-inferiority for participants who completed treatment (completers) and those who were randomized to treatment (intention-to-treat (ITT)). Results Both completer and ITT analyses showed that improvement in CAPS scores in the VC condition was non-inferior to that in the IP condition at six-month follow-up, but VC was inferior to IP for improvement in CAPS at post-treatment. Non-inferiority was supported by completer analyses for PCL–S and PHQ–9 in both post-treatment change and six-month follow-up change, and the ITT analysis supported the significant non-inferiority for PCL at post-treatment change. Discussion These findings generally suggest that CPT delivered via VC can be as effective as IP for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms.",199

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also necessitates the experience of a traumatic event (PTSD criterion A). Research has demonstrated a high degree of comorbidity between these two conditions. However, few studies have examined symptom overlap as a potential cause for this co-occurrence. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine symptom endorsement and overlap between OCD and PTSD using a sample of trauma exposed veterans. Veterans were administered self-report assessments, including the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), as part of a routine clinical care at a Veteran's Administration hospital. Based on self-report assessment of clinical cut scores, 81% of participants met for probable PTSD and 74% for probable OCD. In addition, a series of chi square analyses revealed frequent overlap of endorsement across items with similar content. There is significant overlap between PTSD and OCD symptoms, and patients may find it difficult to differentiate between them on self-report measures. As such, caution should be used when using self-report solely to assess PTSD and OCD, particularly in traumatized samples.",200

Methods: A pre-/post-intervention project design was used, utilizing the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (PCL-5) screening tool. Outcome measures included screening completion, positive screening rate, and referral rate. Results: A total of 331 first responders presented for employment physicals. In the post-intervention cohort, 96% (152/158) of first responders were screened. From pre- to post-intervention, first responders who screened positive increased from less than 1% (1/173) to 4.6% (7/152). Of those screening positive, a total of five of seven (71%) patients were referred for mental health evaluation. Conclusions: A standardized screening protocol using a validated self-assessment tool improved PTSD surveillance in first responders and triggered referral.",201

The current study compared several a priori factor structures, as well as a novel 2-factor structure of posttraumatic psychological distress as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD scale for the DSM-5 (CAPS-5). In addition, variability in diagnostic rates according to the divergent DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria were explored.The setting for this study was a Level 1 trauma center in a U.S. metropolitan city. Data were pooled from 2 studies (N = 309) and participants were administered the CAPS-5 at 1 (n = 139) or 6 months postinjury (n = 170). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to compare several factor models, and prevalence rates based on DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria were compared via z tests and kappa.CFAs of 5 factor structures indicated good fit for all models. A novel 2-factor model based on competing models of PTSD symptoms and modification indices was then tested. The 2-factor model of the CAPS-5 performed as well or better on most indices compared to a 7-factor hybrid. Comparisons of PTSD prevalence rates found no significant differences, but agreement was variable.These findings indicate that the CAPS-5 can be seen as measuring 2 distinct phenomena: posttraumatic stress disorder and general posttraumatic dysphoria. This is an important contribution to the current debate on which latent factors constitute PTSD and may reduce discordance. (PsycINFO Database Record",202

The PTSD Checklist (PCL), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), State subscale of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) were administered.When the assessments for day 2 and month 12 were compared, all the scales, except the PCL-avoidance subscale, showed a significant improvement in symptoms among males. However, among females, all the scales, except the PCL-re-experience subscale and the STAI-S, failed to show a significant improvement. All the symptoms for both males and females showed a pattern that decreased to the lowest level at month 1 (camp-based controlled intervention period), then increased at months 6 and 12 (voluntary individual treatment after returning to school).The rapid deterioration of psychological symptoms was found during the chronic phase, when students returned to their daily routines and received voluntary individual therapy.

Because a PTSD diagnosis is often missed in patients with psychosis in routine care, a valid screening instrument could be helpful.To determine the validity of the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ) as a screening tool for PTSD among individuals with psychotic disorders.Among 2608 patients with a psychotic disorder, the rate of trauma exposure was determined and the TSQ was administered to screen for PTSD. PTSD status was verified in 455 patients using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (trial registration: ISRCTN 79584912).Trauma exposure was reported by 78.2% of the 2608 patients. PTSD prevalence was estimated at 16% (95% CI 14.6-17.4%) compared with 0.5% reported in the patients' clinical charts. A TSQ cut-off score of six predicted PTSD with 78.8% sensitivity, 75.6% specificity, 44.5% correct positives and 93.6% correct negatives.The TSQ seems to be a valid screening tool for PTSD in patients with a psychotic disorder.",204

We examined whether 60-min PE sessions were as effective and efficient as 90-min PE sessions.In total, 160 active-duty military personnel with PTSD were randomized to 8-15 sessions of 60- or 90-min PE sessions and assessed pre- and posttreatment, and 3- and 6-month posttreatment, using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 5th edition [DSM-5] (CAPS-5). Participants were also assessed weekly during treatment using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). A 60-min PE was hypothesized to be noninferior to 90-min PE based on preliminary studies.Using intent-to-treat analyses, the 95% CI for the difference between 60- and 90-min PE was less than the noninferiority margin (4.69 for the CAPS-5 and 7.38 for the PCL-5) at all three endpoints, suggesting that the efficacy of 60-min PE was noninferior to that of 90-min PE. Similarly, the rate of improvement per session for 60-min PE was noninferior to the rate for 90-min sessions for the PCL-5. Sensitivity analyses and Bayes factors were consistent with these results.60-min sessions of PE are noninferior to 90-min sessions with regard to both efficacy and efficiency. Thus, PE can be effectively delivered in shorter sessions, making it easier for behavioral health providers to implement within the military health system and in other mental health systems that use 60-min session appointments.

Efficient screening instruments are useful to identify at-risk first responders and connect them to services. Aims The current study aimed to (i) evaluate the diagnostic properties of the Primary Care PTSD for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) scale among firefighters, (ii) explore the use of an adapted PC-PTSD-5 on a five-point Likert-type scale and (iii) examine sensitivity and specificity of the adapted instrument in this population. Methods Pooled data were analysed among firefighters (N = 92) from a treatment-seeking sample (n = 36) and a population health screening sample (n = 56). Participants completed an adapted version of the PC-PTSD-5 and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed, referencing PCL-5 cut-off/probable diagnostic threshold scores. Results The PC-PTSD-5 demonstrated excellent operating characteristics overall. A threshold of 3 was optimal for discriminating probable PTSD using a proxy for the original PC-PTSD-5 (range: 0–5), whereas a score of 9 was identified for the PC-PTSD-5 permutation that allowed for more response variability (range: 0–20). Conclusions Our preliminary data suggest the PC-PTSD-5 may be a useful tool for brief firefighter screening, with suggested cut-offs that require further replication and expanded investigation.",207

The aim of the current study was to examine the degree to which newly established PTSD symptom clusters differentially relate to co-occurring psychopathology and related clinical phenomena through Wald testing using latent variable modeling. Participants were 535 trauma-exposed undergraduates who completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) and Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991). As expected and in line with results from previous studies, significant heterogeneity emerged for dysphoric arousal, anxious arousal, and externalizing behavior. However, there was less evidence for the distinctiveness of negative affect and anhedonia. Results indicate that only some of the newly established symptom clusters significantly differ in their associations with related clinical phenomena and that the hybrid model might not provide a meaningful framework for understanding which PTSD symptoms relate to associated features. Limitations include a non-clinical sample and reliance on retrospective self-report assessment measures.",209

This study aims to evaluate the reliability and validity of the PCL-C as a screen for detecting PTSD symptoms among pregnant women. A total of 3372 pregnant women who attended their first prenatal care visit in Lima, Peru participated in the study. We assessed the reliability of the PCL-C items using Cronbach’s alpha. Criterion validity and performance characteristics of PCL-C were assessed against an independent, blinded Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) interview using measures of sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. We tested construct validity using exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic approaches. The reliability of the PCL-C was excellent (Cronbach’s alpha =0.90). ROC analysis showed that a cut-off score of 26 offered optimal discriminatory power, with a sensitivity of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78–0.92) and a specificity of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.62–0.65). The area under the ROC curve was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71–0.78). A three-factor solution was extracted using exploratory factor analysis and was further complemented with three other models using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In a CFA, a three-factor model based on DSM-IV symptom structure had reasonable fit statistics with comparative fit index of 0.86 and root mean square error of approximation of 0.09. The Spanish-language version of the PCL-C may be used as a screening tool for pregnant women. The PCL-C has good reliability, criterion validity and factorial validity. The optimal cut-off score obtained by maximizing the sensitivity and specificity should be considered cautiously; women who screened positive may require further investigation to confirm PTSD diagnosis.",211

However, its origins remain poorly-understood. Recently, adverse childhood events (ACE), including traumatic experiences, have been found to be significantly associated with both insomnia and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD). Many patients with PTSD suffer from sleep disorders. However, we know much less about traumatic childhood experiences in patients with insomnia and PTSD. Methods Our exploratory study investigated a cohort of 43 patients (14 males, 29 females) clinically diagnosed with chronic insomnia at a sleep center, and systematically evaluated their condition using the trauma history questionnaire (THQ), and the PTSD checklist (PCL-5). Results Our results show that 83.72% of insomnia patients reported at least one traumatic event, while the prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 53.49%. For 11.6% of patients, insomnia began in childhood, while for 27.07% it began in adolescence. PCL-5 scores were associated with higher Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores, but not trauma. ISI scores were also higher for women, and positive relationships were observed between ISI scores, PCL-5 scores and the number of self-reported traumatic events among women. Conclusions These exploratory results highlight that the relationship between PTSD symptoms and insomnia could be sex-specific. They also highlight the importance of PTSD symptoms screening for patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia.",212

A growing body of literature has employed latent class analysis (LCA) to disentangle the complex structure underlying PTS symptomatology, distinguishing between homogeneous subgroups based on PTS presentations. So far, little is known about subgroups or classes of ASD reactions in trauma-exposed children.Objective: Our study aimed to identify latent classes of ASD symptoms in children exposed to a single-incident PTE and to identify predictors of class membership (gender, age, cultural background, parental education, trauma type, and trauma history).Method: A sample of 2287 children and adolescents (5–18 years) was derived from the Prospective studies of Acute Child Trauma and Recovery (PACT/R) Data Archive, an international archive including studies from the USA, UK, Australia, and Switzerland. LCA was used to determine distinct subgroups based on ASD symptoms. Predictors of class membership were examined using a three-step approach.Results: Our LCA yielded a three-class solution: low (42%), intermediate (43%) and high (15%) ASD symptom severity that differed in terms of impairment and number of endorsed ASD symptoms. Compared to the low symptoms class, children in the intermediate or high severity class were more likely to be of female gender, be younger of age, have parents who had not completed secondary education, and be exposed to a road traffic accident or interpersonal violence (vs. an unintentional injury).Conclusions: These findings provide new information on children at risk for ASD after single-incident trauma, based on a unique set of international data. Classifying children based on latent symptom profiles helps to identify target groups for prevention and intervention after exposure to a PTE.",213

Methods: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1 and July 31, 2020, were included in a longitudinal study. Clinical assessments were conducted with online auto-questionnaires. PTSS were assessed with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCLS). We screened for several putative factors associated with PTSS, including socio-demographic status, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, history of psychiatric disorder, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, and the home-to-hospital distance. Bivariate and multilinear regression analyses were performed to evaluate their association with PTSS. Results: 119 patients were evaluated 3 months after hospital discharge, and a subset of 94 were evaluated 6 months after discharge. The prevalence of PTSS was 31.9% after 3 months and 30.9% after 6 months. Symptoms of anxiety and depression and history of psychiatric disorder were independently associated with PTSS. Additionally, dissociative experiences during hospitalization (β = 0.35; P < .001) and a longer home-to-hospital distance (β = 0.07; P = .017) were specifically associated with PTSS 3 and 6 months after discharge, respectively. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 showed persistent high scores of PTSS up to 6 months after discharge from the hospital. In this specific pandemic setting, PTSS were associated with high rates of dissociative experiences during hospitalization and a longer home-to-hospital distance due to the saturation of health care facilities. These results can foster early identification and better prevention of PTSS after hospitalization for COVID-19. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04362930",215

However, as screening is a time-consuming process, it is important to consider ways to reduce the time required, including the use of shorter scales. The scale currently used to assess posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C), is lengthy, although validated shorter versions have been developed that have not yet been evaluated in the CAF population. Methods: Three brief versions of the PCL-C were evaluated in this study: the PCL-2, PCL-4 and PCL-6. The operating characteristics of each scale were examined using the screening and diagnostic cut-offs of the full PCL, as well as clinician ratings of PTSD being of major concern, as the standards for comparison. Optimal cut-offs for each scale were determined based on a combination of sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and prevalence of disorder compared to the full scale. As well, correlations with other measures of health were examined. Results: Although all three scales demonstrated good psychometric properties, the PCL-6 showed the strongest properties of the three scales. Optimal cut-offs were similar to those found in past research when calibrated against the PCL-C screening cut-off for PTSD and to clinician ratings. As well, it exhibited high correlations with other measures of mental health. Discussion: This research provides evidence for the acceptability of brief measures in screening for PTSD in military members following deployment. In particular, it points to the advantages of using the PCL-6, with cut-offs in line with those recommended in past research.",216

In this study, we aimed to examine patterns of co-occurrence between DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and PTG, among natural disaster survivors, and to clarify whether empirically-based subgroups differed by several specific predictors. Methods: Latent profile analysis was used to examine patterns of self-reported PTSD symptoms and PTG in an epidemiological sample of 1063 Chinese earthquake survivors. Results: Three distinct profiles were identified, involving high PTSD/high PTG, mild PTSD/mild PTG, and mild PTSD/high PTG.

Method. Data from two health surveys were combined to create a cohort of 1119 Australian military personnel who deployed to the Middle East between 2000 and 2009. Changes in PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C) scores and the reporting of stressful events between the two self-reported surveys were assessed. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between the number of stressful events reported and PTSD symptoms, and assess whether those who reported new stressful events between the two surveys, were also more likely to report older events. We also assessed, using linear regression, whether higher scores on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale or the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test were associated with subsequent increases in the PCL-C in those who had experienced a stressful event, but who initially had few PTSD symptoms. Results. Overall, the mean PCL-C scores in the two surveys were similar, and 78% of responders stayed in the same PCL-C category. Only a small percentage moved from having few symptoms of PTSD (PCL-C &lt; 30) in Survey 1 to meeting the criteria for PTSD (PCL-C ≥ 50) at Survey 2 (1% of all responders, 16% of those with PCL-C ≥ 50 at Survey 2). Personnel who reported more stressful lifetime events were more likely to score higher on the PCL-C. Only 51% reported the same stressful event on both surveys. People who reported events occurring between the two surveys were more likely to record events from before the first survey which they had not previously mentioned (OR 1.48, 95% CI (1.17, 1.88), p &lt; 0.001), than those who did not. In people who initially had few PTSD symptoms, a higher level of psychological distress, was significantly associated with higher PCL-C scores a few years later. Conclusions. The reporting of stressful events varied over time indicating that while the impact of some stressors endure, others may increase or decline in importance. When screening for PTSD, it is important to consider both traumatic experiences on deployment and other stressful life events, as well as other mental health problems among military personnel, even if individuals do not exhibit symptoms of PTSD on an initial assessment.",220

Offspring of trauma survivors are at increased risk for mental and physical illnesses. Parental PTSD has been linked to troubled parent–child relationships, behaviour problems, trauma symptoms, and depression in children. This study aims to explore the acceptability, feasibility and indications of the effectiveness of group learning through play plus trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy (LTP Plus TF-CBT) for parents experiencing PTSD. Methods/Design This is a two-arm pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aim to recruit 300 parents with a diagnosis of PTSD. The screening will be done using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Diagnosis of PTSD will be confirmed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-5 (CAPS-5). Union Councils from Peshawar and Karachi will be randomised into either group LTP Plus TF CBT arm or treatment as usual (TAU). The intervention includes 12 sessions of LTP Plus TF-CBT delivered weekly in the first 2 months and then fortnightly in a group setting by trained psychologists. The groups will be co-facilitated by the community health workers (CHWs). Parents will be assessed at baseline and 4th month (end of the intervention), using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale, Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI), and Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) Discussion This trial would help build an understanding of the acceptability, feasibility and indications of the effectiveness of a low-cost parenting intervention.",221

The present study tested relationships between ACEs, whole thalamus and thalamic nuclei volumes, and post-trauma stress symptoms (PTSS) after adult trauma. Trauma survivors (n = 101) completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the PTSD checklist-special stressor version 5 (PCL), and a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scan within post-trauma 2 weeks. At post-trauma 3 months, survivors completed a second PCL survey and a PTSD diagnosis interview using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). CTQ scores significantly positively correlated with PCL scores at post-trauma 2 weeks and 3 months (respective p's < 0.01 and < 0.001). CTQ scores significantly negatively correlated with whole thalamus and 7 thalamic nuclei volumes at post-trauma 2 weeks in the PTSD (N = 50), but not the non-PTSD (N = 51) group. Whole thalamus and 22 nuclei volumes significantly negatively correlated with PCL scores at post-trauma 3 months in the PTSD, but not the non-PTSD group. These results suggest ACEs negatively influence early post-trauma thalamic volumes which, in turn, are negatively associated with PTSS in survivors who develop PTSD.",222

Only a few studies have been undertaken among civilian survivors of WWII.The purpose of this study was to examine the association between perceived social acknowledgment of WWII trauma and the level of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms among Polish survivors of WWII by employing a mixed-methods design (i.e., a quantitative analysis supported by qualitative interviews).In the quantitative part, 123 participants filled out: the list of WWII-related traumatic events, the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (PCL-5), the shortened version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Social Acknowledgment Questionnaire (SAQ). In the qualitative part, an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of participants' reminiscences of WWII was examined.Although we observed a direct positive association between the number of WWII-related traumatic events and the intensity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, these relationships changed when we entered the social acknowledgment construct into the model. Specifically, we found that perceived social acknowledgment (general disapproval) was a mediator of the relationship between the number of WWII traumatic events and the intensity of PTSD symptoms only, and not of depressive symptoms. In the qualitative part, three themes relating to traumatic reminiscences emerged among the participants: parental efficacy, parental betrayal, and support from the invader.Our study showed the significance of the general social acknowledgment in the long-term mental consequences of the WWII trauma in Poland. In addition, the results of our study may be an adjunct to the discussion on the long-term impact of WWII trauma in Poland and the factors that hindered its social recognition.",223

This study examined key psychometric properties (e.g., internal consistency, test-retest reliability, interrater reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity) of the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview for DSM-5 (PSSI-5), a modified version of the PSS-I (PTSD Symptom Scale)-Interview Version for the DSM-IV. Participants were 242 urban community residents, veterans, and college undergraduates, recruited from 3 study sites, who had experienced a DSM-5 Criterion A traumatic event. The PSSI-5 demonstrated good internal consistency (α = .89) and test-retest reliability (r = .87), as well as excellent interrater reliability for the total severity score (intraclass correlation = .98) and interrater agreement for PTSD diagnosis (κ = .84). The PSSI-5 also demonstrated convergent validity with 3 measures of PTSD (i.e., Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5, and PTSD Checklist-Specific Version; all rs > .72) and discriminant validity with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait scale. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded a cutoff score of 23 for identifying a probable PTSD diagnosis. Together, these findings indicate that the PSSI-5 is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing PTSD diagnosis and severity. (PsycINFO Database Record",224

Veterans 18–60 years of age with current combat-related PTSD symptoms were randomized, using a 1:1 ratio in a parallel design, to active (rTMS+CPT) versus sham (sham+CPT) rTMS just prior to weekly CPT for 12–15 sessions. Blinded raters evaluated veterans at baseline, after the 5th and 9th treatments, and at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment. Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was the primary outcome measure with the PTSD Checklist (PCL) as a secondary outcome measure. The TMS coil (active or sham) was positioned over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (110% MT, 1 Hz continuously for 30 min, 1800 pulses/treatment). Of the 515 individuals screened for the study, 103 participants were randomized to either active (n = 54) or sham rTMS (n = 49). Sixty-two participants (60%) completed treatment and 59 (57%) completed the 6-month assessment. The rTMS+CPT group showed greater symptom reductions from baseline on both CAPS and PCL across CPT sessions and follow-up assessments, t(df ≥ 325) ≤ −2.01, p ≤ 0.023, one-tailed and t(df ≥ 303) ≤ −2.14, p ≤ 0.017, one-tailed, respectively. Participants were predominantly male and limited to one era of conflicts as well as those who could safely undergo rTMS. The addition of rTMS to CPT compared to sham with CPT produced significantly greater PTSD symptom reduction early in treatment and was sustained up to six months post-treatment.",225
https://openalex.org/W2615680492,10.1016/j.psychres.2017.05.026,Examination of polytrauma typologies: A latent class analysis approach,"Potentially traumatizing events (PTE) are highly prevalent, and are associated with detrimental effects on psychological health, including increased risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Multiple endorsed PTEs (polytraumatization) may have even greater effects on a person's health than the impact of a single index event. To better understand patterns of polytraumatization, person-centered analytic techniques such as Latent class analysis (LCA) are recommended. The current study used LCA to explore latent subgroupings of people based on their endorsement of PTEs, thus defining patterns in PTE exposure. The sample included 850 participants who endorsed at least one PTE on a web-administered Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ). Results indicated a best-fitting 3-class solution: (1) a class with a greater probability of experiencing interpersonal PTEs and other PTEs, (2) a class with moderate PTE exposure and higher probability of mugging and accidents, and (3) a class with low PTE exposure. Differences in age, gender, and PTSD symptom severity accounted for class membership. Results suggest the experience of interpersonal PTEs may be a risk factor for additional lifetime PTE exposure, and is associated with increased PTSD severity. Additional findings underscore the heterogenity of trauma experiences, highlighting the importance of examining such patterns in future research.",226

PTSD is composed of 20 symptoms across four clusters. However, 20-item measures can be burdensome to administer frequently, especially in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) where multiple assessments are conducted per day. An abbreviated 8-item version of the PCL-5 was developed to obtain information about PTSD symptoms at reduced effort to the participant. However, the symptom severity scale by which symptoms can range between the abbreviated (0–32) and full (0–80) scales differ, which limits the interpretability of the abbreviated scale. The current study evaluated three different methods (a proportional, linear regression, and genetic programming model) to convert scores from the abbreviated measure to that of the full PCL. These equations were then compared across two testing samples to assess their accuracy and bias. The genetic programming and linear regression equation were superior to a proportional equation in both measures of accuracy and bias, with the genetic programming equation demonstrating less bias overall than the linear regression. Furthermore, the diagnostic utility of each method was found to be similar. These results provide a method to convert abbreviated PCL scores to that of the full scale, which increases the utility of this abbreviated scale.",227

However, studies on RRDs in youth are limited to mental health sequelae of depression and prolonged grief. Little is known about the association between RRDs and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and how this compares to posttraumatic stress symptoms following a traumatogenic event.Objective: We aimed to determine the association between RRDs and PTSS in an EAS sample; and how this compared to the association between posttraumatic stress symptoms and a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5th edition (DSM-5) traumatic event.Method: University students (N = 2,022; female = 71.1%; 18-25 years) completed a demographic and relationship questionnaire, the Life Events Checklist, the Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire, and the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist (PCL). We compared EAS with an RRD (n = 886) or a DSM-5 criterion A traumatic event (n = 592) against a control group (n = 544) exposed to a non-traumatic stressful life event. Utilising ANOVAs and Pearson's correlations we determined demographic and clinical variables associated with PTSS. ANCOVA and stepwise hierarchical regression analyses were used to determine between-group differences in PTSS.Results: Total trauma exposure and adverse childhood experiences, sex, monthly income, sexual orientation, and attachment style were significantly associated with PTSS. The RRD group had significantly higher PCL scores compared to the DSM and control groups. The mean PCL scores for both the RRD and DSM groups were above the cut-off score of 33, consistent with a probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Significantly more RRD participants (72.9%) scored above the cut-off score of 33 than DSM-5 Trauma Group participants (55.4%).Conclusion: An RRD is a potentially traumatic event and is significantly associated with PTSS, similar to a posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis.Students may experience non-marital romantic relationship breakups as very painful, with various negative psychological, physical, and academic consequences. However, their painful experiences are often trivialised as something to ‘just get over’ and not acknowledged as potentially traumatic. Yet, using an attachment theory framework, breakups can be reconceptualised as subjectively traumatic.We explored the differences in posttraumatic stress symptoms of students who experienced a breakup, a traumatic event (as defined in psychiatry), and other non-traumatic life events. Students who experienced a breakup reported significantly highly posttraumatic stress symptoms.Acknowledging students’ pain following a self-defined traumatic breakup can increase help-seeking behaviour and reduce the risk of intergenerational attachment trauma. Our findings warrant further research of breakups as potentially traumatogenic events.",228

https://openalex.org/W2982059186,10.1111/acem.13878,Are There Long‐term Consequences to Psychological Stress During a Medical Event?,"The experience of being treated for an acute medical event is a frightening and stressful experience for many patients. Understanding the impact of psychological stress during medical events is important, not only for our understanding of the potential development of short- and long-term adverse psychological outcomes but also for its implications with broader health and recovery. In their recent study, Moss et al.1 assessed patient perceived fear (e.g., “threat”) during evaluation of a life-threatening cardiovascular or respiratory event. In this sample of 99 patients, they found that almost all (98%) patients who completed the assessment reported some degree of perceived threat on a validated screening measure, while 72% of individuals reported posttraumatic symptoms in relation to their ED visit at follow-up. (median [range] score = 7 [0-30]). The results of this study build on previous work in the emergency department setting noting the association of psychological stress and development of sustained psychological symptoms in medically ill patients,2 although the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported at follow-up in this sample appear significantly higher than previously published rates of PTSD following cardiac event. A meta-analysis summarizing 24 studies and 2,383 patients found an aggregated prevalence estimate of PTSD in one in six survivors of an acute coronary syndrome,3 with similar incidence of PTSD noted in survivors of other life-threating conditions such as stroke.4 The authors reported their findings of PTSD symptoms at follow-up using raw scores on the PCL-5, a widely used and validated instrument for posttraumatic symptom assessment.5 While details were provided in the article regarding distributions for the initial threat assessment, further details on the frequency and distribution of the subsequent PCL-5 scores would have provided readers additional information on patients’ levels of anxiety and if the symptom severity reported by patients approached cutoff scores, suggesting possible clinical PTSD. The reported prevalence of 72% of patients endorsing some PTSD symptoms following a life-threatening event is tempered by the relatively low median score of PCL-5 of patients reporting PTSD symptoms at follow-up (i.e., 7), where cutoff scores of 30 and above commonly conceptualized as probable PTSD.5 Building on this, a broader clinical question remains unanswered: even if patients following acute medical events may endorse anxiety symptoms, how does one tease apart what is likely an anticipated and expected psychological reaction to having survived an acute medical event to manifestations of an adverse and maladaptive process that would benefit from potential intervention? Additionally, in this sample, a diverse group of cardiac and pulmonary medical events were aggregated as “life-threatening illness.” Are the psychological processes experienced during specific medical events like an acute coronary event particularly high risk for the development of sustained psychological symptoms, compared to other events, such as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation? These questions remain unanswered by this study and will likely necessitate a series of longitudinal prospective studies of large cohorts of patients with inclusion criteria careful to distinguish between samples of patients with various medical events and an extensive range of measures and outcomes drawn from diverse biopsychosocial candidate factors in survivors. Several active federally funded prospective studies are currently under way examining the development of psychological and somatic symptoms in ED survivors of acute events from trauma (U01 MH110925: AURORA), ischemic stroke (HL 141811), and cardiac events (HL 132347). Data from these projects and others will complement the work presented by Moss et al.1 and build on our understanding of psychological recovery following acute medical events. In their primary analysis, Moss et al.1 found that there was no significant association with environmental factors, such as ED crowding and subsequent PTSD symptom severity. Other studies, with larger samples, have found a correlation between environmental factors such as ED crowding and PTSD severity, using different operationalizations of crowding, such as the EDWIN score.6 Given the relatively small effect sizes for this previously reported difference, the modest sample of this study (n = 99) may have been underpowered to detect possible significant changes in this secondary aim of their study. Future studies evaluating this relationship using a variety of measures of operationalized environmental factors across larger samples may assess the stability and reproducibility of any such findings. Additionally, the inclusion of ED crowding in this study, also raises the concept that, beyond state and trait factors attributed to the patient, other aspects of the acute care experience itself may influence the development of adverse psychological reactions during the event. For example, past studies have noted the association of posttraumatic stress symptoms in survivors of acute medical events in other acute care environmental factors not included in this study, including hallway care,7 maladaptive patterns of social support,8 preexisting depressive states,9 and clinician–patient communication.10 Integrating and exploring the potential links between these environmental factors, with preexisting state and trait variables, may lead to the nuanced understanding and appreciation of the hospitalization experience experienced by patients being treated for a life- threatening event.11 Emergency providers are clinicians skilled at managing life- threatening conditions across a range of physiologic organ systems. Understanding the psychological reactions experienced by patients during such events provides another layer of information regarding the acute experience of patients treated in the ED. The work by Moss et al.1 is an important contribution to our understanding of the sustained effects that psychological stress during acute medical events may have on long-term patient well-being. Work building on this study will improve our understanding of these effects and ideally lead to the identification of modifiable targets of interventions to improve patient recovery in the near- and long-term setting.",230

Several empirical studies have supported the distinction between PTSD and CPTSD in various trauma population and different culture backgrounds. However, research documenting qualitatively distinction between PTSD and CPTSD using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) in a large general population from non-English-speaking countries is limited. Self-report measures were used to assess CPTSD, dissociation, depression, and posttraumatic growth in a sample of 1,760 Chinese college students who had experienced at least one traumatic event. Latent profile analysis was utilized to identify the number of classes based on the 18-item version of ITQ. A four-class solution (low symptoms, disturbance of self-organization, PTSD, CPTSD) was the most appropriate one in our study. Compared to the PTSD class, the CPTSD class was associated with more serious psychopathology symptoms. Sample characteristics in this study limit its generalizability to other population (e.g., low educational level, clinical sample). The type of traumatic event in predicting distinct classes should also be investigated in future studies. Distinction between PTSD and CPTSD as ICD-11 proposed was supported in a Chinese young adult sample. DSO symptoms might inhibit healing and recovery process, and subsequent intervention could consider treat CPTSD based on addressing DSO symptoms.",231

The recurrence of the chest pain was more frequent in the PTSD group of patients. Patients with PTSD symptoms were more likely to report a non-therapeutic adherence to their cardiovascular medication.Stress management in EDs should become a systematic step in the management of patients with ACS.

In the present study, we investigated the associations between specific features of event centrality (EC), as measured using the Centrality of Event Scale, and specific symptoms of PTSD. We computed a cross-sectional graphical lasso network of PTSD symptoms and specific features of EC in a sample of trauma-exposed individuals (n = 451), many of whom met the clinical threshold for a PTSD diagnosis. The graphical lasso revealed intrusive memories, negative trauma-related feelings, and the perception that the traumatic event was central to one's identity to be influential nodes. Viewing the future through the lens of one's trauma exposure was the EC feature most strongly linked to PTSD. Among all PTSD symptoms, blaming oneself or others for the traumatic event showed the strongest link to EC. The network was stable, allowing for reliable interpretations. Future longitudinal research is needed to clarify the associations among EC features and PTSD symptoms over time.",233

We estimated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios for different cut-off points of the IES-R, against a diagnosis of PTSD made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. We performed factor analysis to evaluate construct validity of the IES-R.The prevalence of PTSD was 23.9% (95% CI 18.9-29.5). The area under the curve for the IES-R was 0.90.

https://openalex.org/W2970662042,10.1037/tra0000509,Posttraumatic stress disorder and measurement invariance in a sample of sexual assault survivors: Are symptom clusters stable over time?,"Many sexual assault victims develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after their assault, the symptoms of which can last for months or years. Although severity of PTSD symptoms generally decreases over time, it is unclear whether symptom clusters decrease at a consistent pace or whether certain symptom clusters resolve more quickly than do others. Put in terms of measurement invariance, do all symptom clusters maintain stable contributions to the underlying construct of PTSD over time? This article responds to that question by analyzing longitudinal data collected from a diverse sample of sexual assault survivors.We conducted a longitudinal confirmatory factor analysis to assess measurement invariance of the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale. We also tested the impact of time since the assault and revictimization between measurement occasions on posttraumatic stress symptoms.Results indicated that although 3 out of 4 symptom clusters remained stable, the contribution of the dysphoria symptom cluster to the latent factor of PTSD varied over time. Findings also suggested that whereas time since the assault was not a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms, revictimization between Wave 1 and Wave 2 surveys did predict posttraumatic stress at the 2nd measurement occasion.Trauma researchers and practitioners are advised to monitor item-level movement on dysphoria scales rather than focus on the average cluster score, because items in this symptom cluster may change in a less predictable way than do items in other symptom clusters. Lack of attention to this issue may lead to inaccurate or incomplete conclusions about how PTSD symptom clusters evolve over time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",235
https://openalex.org/W2924894633,10.1016/j.jad.2019.03.064,Dimensional structure of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after cardiac arrest,"Considerable evidence suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous construct despite often being treated as a homogeneous diagnostic entity. PTSD in response to cardiac arrest is common and may differ from PTSD following other medical traumas. Most patients are amnesic from the cardiac event, and it is unclear if and how certain PTSD symptoms may manifest. We examined the latent structure of PTSD symptoms in 104 consecutive cardiac arrest survivors who were admitted to Columbia University Medical Center. PTSD symptoms were assessed via the PTSD Checklist-Specific at hospital discharge. We performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to compare 4-factor dysphoria, 4-factor numbing, and 5-factor dysphoric arousal models of PTSD with our data. The CFA showed that each of the models had good fit. We chose the 4-factor numbing model (χ2 (113) = 151.59, p < .01, CFI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.057, 90% CI: [0.032, 0.081]) as most representative of the data, after considering a between-factor correlation of 0.99 in the 5-factor dysphoric arousal model, and greater fit statistics than the 4-factor dysphoria model. Certain factors were defined by only two items. Additionally, PTSD was assessed at discharge (median = 21 days); those assessed before 30 days could be displaying symptoms of acute stress disorder. Our findings suggest that PTSD symptoms after cardiac arrest are best represented by a 4-factor numbing model of PTSD. PTSD assessment and intervention efforts for cardiac arrest survivors should consider the underlying dimensions of PTSD.",236

In a population of 495 civilian, traumatic brain injury patients, the PCL-5, the Generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire and the Depression scale of the Patient health questionnaire were administered. The PCL-5 was translated in Dutch following a strict procedure of linguistic validation and cognitive debriefing. Results show an excellent internal consistency and high criterion validity. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a good fit for the four-factor DSM-5 model, but a superior fit for the six-factor Anhedonia model and the seven-factor Hybrid model, similar to the English version of the PCL-5. Preliminary validation of the Dutch translation of the PCL-5 was proven to be psychometrically sound and can be used for clinical and academic purposes, specifically for TBI patients. Future research should examine concurrent and discriminant validity for the Dutch translation in broader populations at risk for PTSD, and include a structured interview to evaluate diagnostic utility.",237

Until now we have little data on how DSM-5 PTSD symptom dimensions relate to different aspects of HRQoL. Clarifying this question would be informative to improve the quality of life of PTSD patients. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dimensions of a well-supported seven-factor model of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms on physical and psychosocial HRQoL. A total of 1063 adult survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake took part in this study nine years after the disaster. PTSD symptoms were measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). HRQoL was measured by the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36). The associations between PTSD symptom dimensions and HRQoL were examined using structural equation models. Dysphoric arousal symptoms were found to significantly relate to physical HRQoL. Other symptom dimensions were not associated with HRQoL. Our findings contribute to the relationship between DSM-5 PTSD and HRQoL, and carry implications for further clinical practice and research on trauma-exposed individuals.",238

This study aimed to measure symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Chinese patients following a new diagnosis of lung cancer. Secondary aims were to explore factors at diagnosis that may predict PTSD symptoms at 6 months. Methods. This was a prospective longitudinal observational study that included 93 patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer. PTSD symptomology was assessed using the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed with the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire. Measures were completed at diagnosis and 6 months. Results. No patient had PTSD at baseline or 6 months as measured by a score of ⩾50 in the PCL-C. However, at diagnosis, 44% of patients had “mild” symptoms of PTSD. At 6 months, 64% of patients had “mild” and 8% had “moderate” PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptom scores significantly worsened over 6 months (mean difference [95% CI] = 7.2 [5.4 to 9.0]). Six months after diagnosis, higher PTSD scores were seen in people who at diagnosis were younger ( P = .003), had a lower smoking pack history ( P = .012), displayed less sedentary behavior ( P &lt; .005), or initially had worse cancer symptoms, including fatigue ( P = .001) and poorer HRQoL ( P = .004). Conclusions. Mild PTSD symptoms are common in patients with lung cancer 6 months after treatment; however, a full diagnosis of PTSD is uncommon. Screening for PTSD symptoms may be considered for at-risk patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer.",239

The study aims to investigate the prevalence of PTSD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision ( DSM-IV-TR ) criteria in a large sample of patients with MS. A total of 988 patients with MS were screened with the Impact of Event Scale–Revised, and then assessed with the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale to confirm PTSD diagnosis. Posttraumatic symptoms were reported by 25.5% of the sample. A confirmed diagnosis of PTSD was found in 5.7% of patients, but prevalence could reach 8.5%, including also dropout patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate if adjustment disorder could better encompass the frequently encountered subthreshold posttraumatic stress symptoms and how clinicians can deal with these symptoms with appropriate interventions.",240

Early intervention reduces the development of PTSD, but few trauma patients seek and obtain care. Valid and reliable screening tools are needed to identify patients at risk of developing PTSD. The objective of this review is to identify existing screening tools and evaluate their accuracy for predicting PTSD outcomes.PubMed, PsychInfo, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for studies evaluating the predictive accuracy of PTSD screening tools among traumatically injured adult civilians. Eligible studies assessed patients during acute hospitalization and at least 1 month following injury to measure PTSD outcome. Eligible outcomes included measures of predictive accuracy, such as sensitivity and specificity. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias of each study, and the strength of evidence was assessed following the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines.Forty-nine studies were included evaluating the predictive accuracy of 38 screening tools. Most tools were assessed in a single study. Questionnaire-style tools had more favorable predictive ability than diagnostic interview assessments. The Injured Trauma Survivor Screen, Posttraumatic Adjustment Screen, the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and the Richmond et al. tool demonstrated the most favorable predictive accuracy, with high sensitivity (75-100%) and specificity (67-94%). Common sources of bias were selection bias due to high attrition rate and using nondiagnostic tools to assess PTSD symptoms at follow-up.Although sensitivity and specificity of PTSD predictive tools varied widely, several emerged with favorable predictive accuracy. Further research is needed to define the ability of screening and intervention to prevent PTSD in injured trauma survivors. The results of this review can inform screening tool options for screening programs and future intervention studies.Systematic review, level III.",241

Treatments with long-term benefits are needed to promote the safety and well-being of those suffering from PTSD.To examine long-term change in PTSD symptoms and additional benefits/harms after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD.Participants received two to three active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg) during blinded or open-label psychotherapy sessions with additional non-drug therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM IV (CAPS-IV) at baseline, 1 to 2 months after the last active MDMA session (treatment exit), and at least 12 months post final MDMA session (LTFU). A mixed-effect repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis assessed changes in CAPS-IV total severity scores. The number of participants who met PTSD diagnostic criteria was summarized at each time point. Participants completed a long-term follow-up questionnaire.There was a significant reduction in CAPS-IV total severity scores from baseline to treatment exit (LS mean (SE) = - 44.8 (2.82), p < .0001), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.58 (95% CI = 1.24, 1.91). CAPS-IV scores continued to decrease from treatment exit to LTFU (LS mean (SE) = - 5.2 (2.29), p < .05), with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.23 (95% CI = 0.04, 0.43). The number of participants who no longer met PTSD criteria increased from treatment exit (56.0%) to LTFU (67.0%). The majority of participants reported benefits, including improved relationships and well-being, and a minority reported harms from study participation.PTSD symptoms were reduced 1 to 2 months after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, and symptom improvement continued at least 12 months post-treatment.

Objective: The current study aimed to critically evaluate the application of the techniques LCA and LPA as applied in previous studies to substantiate the construct validity of CPTSD. Method: Both LCA and LPA were applied systematically in one sample (n = 245), replicating the setup of previous studies as closely as possible. The interpretation of classes was augmented with the use of graphical visualization. Results: The LCA and LPA analyses indicated divergent results in the same dataset. LCA and LPA partially supported the existence of classes of patients endorsing different PTSD and CPTSD symptom patterns. However, further inspection of the results with scatterplots did not support a clear distinction between PTSD and CPTSD, but rather suggested that there is much greater variability in clinical presentations amongst adult PTSD patients than can be fully accounted for by either PTSD or CPTSD. Discussion: We argue that LCA and LPA may not be sufficient methods to decide on the construct validity of CPTSD, as different subgroups of patients are identified, depending on the statistical exact method used and the interpretation of the fit of different models. Additional methods, including graphical inspection should be employed in future studies.Antecedentes: El diagnóstico de Trastorno por Estrés Postraumático Complejo (TEPTC) ha sido sugerido para su inclusión en la 11ª versión de la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades (CIE-11), con el respaldo de su validez de constructo proveniente de estudios que emplean Análisis de Clases Latentes (LCA) y Análisis de Perfil Latente (APL).Objetivo: El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar críticamente la aplicación de las técnicas LCA y APL, utilizadas en estudios anteriores, para corroborar la validez de constructo del TEPTC.Método: Se aplicaron sistemáticamente, tanto la técnica LCA como la técnica APL, en una muestra (n = 245), que buscó replicar lo más fielmente posible las configuraciones empleadas en estudios previos. La interpretación de las clases se potenció con el uso de visualización gráfica.Resultados: Los análisis LCA y APL indicaron resultados divergentes en el mismo conjunto de datos. LCA y APL apoyaron parcialmente la existencia de clases de pacientes que validan diferentes patrones de síntomas para el TEPT y el TEPTC. Sin embargo, una mayor inspección de los resultados con diagramas de dispersión no respaldó una distinción clara entre el TEPT y el TEPTC, sino que sugirieron que existe una variabilidad mucho mayor en las presentaciones clínicas entre los pacientes adultos con TEPT de lo que pueda explicarse ya sea por el TEPT o el TEPTC.Discusión: Proponemos que los análisis LCA y APL pueden ser métodos insuficientes para decidir sobre la validez de constructo del TEPTC, ya que se identifican diferentes subgrupos de pacientes, que depende del método estadístico utilizado y la interpretación del ajuste de diferentes modelos. En futuros estudios deben emplearse métodos adicionales que incluyan la inspección gráfica.背景: 复杂性创伤后应激障碍 (CPTSD) 的诊断已被建议纳入第11版《国际疾病分类》 (ICD-11) 中, 且有使用潜在类别分析 (LCA) 和潜在剖面分析 (LPA) 的研究支持其结构效度。目标: 本研究旨在严格评估LCA和LPA技术在前人证实CPTSD结构效度的研究中的应用。方法: 在一个245人的样本中系统地应用LCA和LPA, 尽可能重复前人研究的设置。使用图形可视化来提高对类别的解读。结果: LCA和LPA分析在同一数据集中显示出不同的结果。 LCA和LPA部分支持存在不同PTSD和CPTSD症状模式的患者类别。但是, 用散点图进一步检查的结果并不支持PTSD和CPTSD之间有明确的差别, 而是表明成年PTSD患者临床表现的变异性要比其可被PTSD或CPTSD完全解释的可能性大得多。讨论: 我们认为, LCA和LPA可能不足以确定CPTSD的结构效度, 因为根据所用的精确统计方法和对不同模型拟合度的解释, 识别出了不同的患者亚组。未来的研究应采用其他方法, 包括图形检查。.",243

This study examines the extent of DSM-IV PTSD 11–13 years after the disaster in WTC responders, its symptom profiles and trajectories, and associations of active, remitted and partial PTSD with exposures, physical health and psychosocial well-being. Method Master's-level psychologists administered sections of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool to 3231 responders monitored at the Stony Brook University World Trade Center Health Program. The PTSD Checklist (PCL) and current medical symptoms were obtained at each visit. Results In all, 9.7% had current, 7.9% remitted, and 5.9% partial WTC-PTSD. Among those with active PTSD, avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms were most commonly, and flashbacks least commonly, reported. Trajectories of symptom severity across monitoring visits showed a modestly increasing slope for active and decelerating slope for remitted PTSD. WTC exposures, especially death and human remains, were strongly associated with PTSD. After adjusting for exposure and critical risk factors, including hazardous drinking and co-morbid depression, PTSD was strongly associated with health and well-being, especially dissatisfaction with life. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate the extent and correlates of long-term DSM-IV PTSD among responders. Although most proved resilient, there remains a sizable subgroup in need of continued treatment in the second decade after 9/11.",246

PTSD can affect anyone, regardless of ethnicity, or culture. An estimated one in every eleven people will experience PTSD during their lifetime. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Check List for Civilians (PCL-C) interviews are gold standards in the diagnosis of PTSD. These questionnaires can be fooled by the subject's responses. This work proposes a deep learning-based approach that achieves state-of-the-art performances for PTSD detection using audio recordings during clinical interviews. Our approach is based on MFCC low-level features extracted from audio recordings of clinical interviews, followed by deep high-level learning using a Stochastic Transformer. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performances with an RMSE of 2.92 on the eDAIC dataset thanks to the stochastic depth, stochastic deep learning layers, and stochastic activation function.",247

Despite the high prevalence, systematic evaluations of evidence-based treatments for PTSD after childhood abuse are sparse.To compare the efficacy of dialectical behavior therapy for PTSD (DBT-PTSD), a new, specifically designed, phase-based treatment program, against that of cognitive processing therapy (CPT), one of the best empirically supported treatments for PTSD.From January 2014 to October 2016, women who sought treatment were included in a multicenter randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessments at 3 German university outpatient clinics. The participants were prospectively observed for 15 months. Women with childhood abuse-associated PTSD who additionally met 3 or more DSM-5 criteria for BPD, including affective instability, were included. Data analysis took place from October 2018 to December 2019.Participants received equal dosages and frequencies of DBT-PTSD or CPT, up to 45 individual sessions within 1 year and 3 additional sessions during the following 3 months.The predefined primary outcome was the course of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) score from randomization to month 15. Intent-to-treat analyses based on dimensional CAPS-5 scores were complemented by categorical outcome measures assessing symptomatic remission, reliable improvement, and reliable recovery.Of 955 consecutive individuals assessed for eligibility, 193 were randomized (DBT-PTSD, 98; CPT, 95; mean [SD] age, 36.3 [11.1] years) and included in the intent-to-treat analyses. Analysis revealed significantly improved CAPS-5 scores in both groups (effect sizes: DBT-PTSD: d, 1.35; CPT: d, 0.98) and a small but statistically significant superiority of DBT-PTSD (group difference: 4.82 [95% CI, 0.67-8.96]; P = .02; d, 0.33). Compared with the CPT group, participants in the DBT-PTSD group were less likely to drop out early (37 [39.0%] vs 25 [25.5%]; P = .046) and had higher rates of symptomatic remission (35 [40.7%] vs 52 [58.4%]; P = .02), reliable improvement (53 [55.8%] vs 73 [74.5%]; P = .006), and reliable recovery (34 [38.6%] vs 52 [57.1%]; P = .01).These findings support the efficacy of DBT-PTSD and CPT in the treatment of women with childhood abuse-associated complex PTSD. Results pertaining to the primary outcomes favored DBT-PTSD. The study shows that even severe childhood abuse-associated PTSD with emotion dysregulation can be treated efficaciously.German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00005578.",248

The trajectory of symptoms in the period of time immediately following the trauma (the acute post-trauma period) may be important in determining which individuals develop PTSD. The current study examined trajectories of PTSD symptom severity across the acute post-trauma period and if membership in these trajectories was predictive of PTSD symptom severity, depression symptoms, and functional impairment 1- and 3-months post-trauma. Four trajectories were identified: low and decreasing, rapid decreasing, slow decreasing, and consistently high. Further, trajectory membership in the acute post-trauma period was found to predict differences in PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and functional impairment severity at both 1- and 3- months post-trauma. These findings highlight a relationship between PTSD symptoms during the acute post-trauma period and later impairment.",249

We used archival data from 283 previously war-zone deployed Canadian veterans. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to uncover patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity as measured via the PTSD Checklist-Military version (PCL-M) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Individual membership of latent classes was used in a series of one-way ANOVAs to ascertain group differences related to HRF as measured via the Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). LPA resulted in three discrete patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity which were characterized by high symptoms of PTSD and MDD, moderate symptoms, and low symptoms. All ANOVAs comparing class membership on the SF-36 subscales were statistically significant demonstrating group differences across levels of HRF. The group with the highest symptoms reported the worst HRF followed by the medium and low symptom groups. These findings are clinically relevant as they demonstrate the need for continual assessment and targeted treatment of co-occurring PTSD and MDD.",250

Patients having an Impact Event Scale-Revisited greater than or equal to 35 at 3 months were considered as having post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.Among the 208 patients screened, 174 were included and 145 reassessed by phone at 3 months. Among the patients included at baseline, 43% presented symptoms of acute stress. At 3 months, 13% had an Impact Event Scale-Revisited greater than or equal to 35 and 17% had a score between 12 and 34. Regarding the performance of the Impact Event Scale-Revisited performed within 8 days after the ICU discharge to predict post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at 3 months, the area under the curve was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.80-0.99), and an Impact Event Scale-Revisited greater than or equal to 12 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 71%, a positive predictive value of 32%, and a negative predictive value of 98%.

We examined the internal consistency (α), convergent and discriminant validity, the factor structure of the CATS-2 total scores, latent classes of PTSD/Complex PTSD (CPTSD) discrimination, as well as the diagnostic utility using ROC-curves.The DSM-5 total score (self: α = .89; caregiver: α = .91), the ICD-11 PTSD total score (self: α = .67; caregiver: α = .79) and the ICD-11 CPTSD total score (self: α = .83; caregiver: α = .87) have proven acceptable to excellent reliability. The latent structure of the 12-item ICD-11 PTSD/CPTSD construct was consistent with prior findings. Latent profile analyses revealed that ICD-11 CPTSD was empirically distinguishable from ICD-11 PTSD using the CATS-2. ROC-analysis using the CAPS-CA-5 as outcome revealed that CATS-2 DSM-5 PTSD scores of ≥21 (screening) to ≥25 (diagnostic) were optimally efficient for detecting probable DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis. For the ICD-11 PTSD scale scores of ≥7 (screening) to ≥9 (diagnostic) were optimally efficient for detecting probable DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis.The CATS-2 is a brief, reliable and valid measure of DSM-5 PTSD, ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD symptomatology in traumatized children and adolescents, allowing crosswalk between diagnostic systems using one measure.The CATS-2 screens for potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and PTSD symptoms.The CATS-2 captures DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria for PTSD and CPTSD and enables clinicians and researchers to crosswalk between both diagnostic systems.International validation has proven good psychometric properties and presents cut-off scoresThe CATS-2 is a license-free instrument and is freely accessible.El estudio examinó las propiedades psicométricas del tamizaje de trauma para niños y adolescentes 2(CATS-2, por sus siglas en inglés) como una medida del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) según el DSM-5 y el TEPT complejo siguiendo los criterios de la CIE-11 en niños y adolescentes (7–17 años).Se investigaron las propiedades psicométricas en una muestra internacional de niños y adolescentes traumatizados (N = 283) y sus cuidadores (N = 255). Examinamos la consistencia interna (α), la validez convergente y discriminante, la estructura factorial de las puntuaciones totales del CATS-2, las clases latentes de discriminación por TEPT/TEPT complejo (TEPTC), así como la utilidad diagnóstica utilizando curvas ROC.La puntuación total del TEPT del DSM-5 (muestra: α = .89; cuidadores: α = .91), la puntuación total de TEPT de la CIE-11 (muestra: α = .67; cuidadores: α = .79) y la puntuación total del TEPTc de la CIE-11 (muestra: α = 0,83; cuidadores: α = 0,87) ha demostrado una fiabilidad de aceptable a excelente. La estructura latente del constructo CIE-11 TEPT/TEPTC de 12 ítems fue consistente con hallazgos previos. Los análisis de perfil latente revelaron que TEPTC DE LA cie-11 era empíricamente diferente del TEPT de la CIE-11utilizando CATS-2. El análisis ROC utilizando el CAPS-CA-5 como resultado reveló que las puntuaciones de TEPT según el DSM-5 del CATS-2 de ≥21 (detección) a ≥25 (diagnóstico) fueron óptimamente eficientes para detectar el diagnóstico probable de TEPT según el DSM-5. Para la escala de TEPT de la CIE-11, las puntuaciones de ≥7 (cribado) a ≥9 (diagnóstico) fueron óptimamente eficientes para detectar el diagnóstico probable de TEPT del DSM-5.El CATS-2 es un instrumento breve, fiable y válido para la sintomatología del TEPT del DSM-5, el TEPT de la CIE-11 y el TEPTC en niños y adolescentes traumatizados, que permite el cruce entre sistemas de diagnóstico utilizando un único instrumento.本研究考查了儿童和青少年创伤筛查 2 (CATS-2)作为一项根据 DSM-5 和（复杂性）创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 测量儿童和青少年（7–17 岁）PTSD的心理测量学特性。.在一个遭受创伤的儿童和青少年 (N = 283) 及其照顾者 (N = 255) 的国际样本中考查心理测量特性。我们考查了内部一致性 (α)、收敛和区分效度、CATS-2 总分的因子结构、PTSD/复杂性 PTSD (CPTSD) 区分的潜在类别，以及使用 ROC 曲线的诊断效能。.DSM-5 总分（自我：α = .89；照顾者：α = .91）、ICD-11 PTSD 总分（自我：α = .67；照顾者：α = .79）和 ICD- 11 CPTSD 总分（自我：α = .83；看护者：α = .87）已被证明具有出色的可靠性。 12 条目 ICD-11 PTSD/CPTSD 构念的潜在结构与先前的发现一致。潜在剖面分析显示使用 CATS-2可在经验上将 ICD-11 CPTSD与ICD-11 PTSD 区分开来。使用 CAPS-CA-5 作为结果的 ROC 分析显示，CATS-2 DSM-5 PTSD 评分≥21（筛查）至≥25（诊断）对于检测可能的 DSM-5 PTSD 诊断是最有效的。对于 ICD-11 PTSD 量表评分≥7（筛查）至≥9（诊断）对于检测可能的 DSM-5 PTSD 诊断是最有效的。.CATS-2 是对遭受创伤儿童和青少年的 DSM-5 PTSD、ICD-11 PTSD 和 CPTSD 症状的一项简短、可靠和有效的测量，使得用一种测量穿行于诊断系统之间成为可能。.",253

In survivors, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) are predictive of poor clinical outcome and subjective recovery. This study tested the hypothesis that PTS is associated with QoL in survivors and caregivers. Method: We distributed an online survey to CA survivors and caregivers who were members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. This analysis examined the following items: participant characteristics, PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and physical, psychological, and social QoL subscales of the WHOQOL-BREF. We followed an identical analytic plan for survivors and caregivers. We identified potential covariates through a bivariate correlation matrix. We then ran three multiple regression models examining associations between PCL-5 scores with each QoL subscale, adjusted for covariates identified from the correlation matrix. Results: A total of 163 survivors (mean age: 50.1 years, 50.3% women, 95.5% white, mean months since arrest: 63.9) and 52 caregivers (mean age: 51.8 years, 86.5% women, 88.5% white, mean months since arrest: 43.2) provided full data. For survivors, the following variables showed significant bivariate associations with any QoL subscale: Lawton scores, self-reported memory problems, male sex, low income, months since CA, age, and CA location; for caregivers, months since CA, age, and low income. In survivors and caregivers, PCL-5 scores were associated with each QoL subscale (β: -.33 - -.54, p &lt; .05) after adjusting for respective covariate sets. Further, in survivors, Lawton scores (β: .23, p &lt;.01), presence of memory problems (β: -.24, p &lt; .01), and male sex (β: .14, p &lt;.05) were associated with physical QoL; presence of memory problems (β: -.26, p &lt; .01) was associated with psychological QoL; and low income (β: -.16, p &lt; .05) was associated with social QoL. In caregivers, months since CA was associated with social QoL (β: .27, p &lt;.05). Conclusion: PTS was associated with QoL in CA survivors and caregivers. Future study should examine the feasibility of in-hospital assessment of PTS in dyads of CA survivors and their caregivers.",254

This study examined the trajectories of PTSD symptom severity and substance use among individuals recently exposed to a traumatic event, with a focus on the potential moderating roles of PTSD and SUD diagnoses at the final assessment. Additionally, in attempt to better understand the functional relationship between PTSD symptoms and substance use posttrauma, this study compared models reflecting the theories of self-medication, susceptibility, and mutual maintenance. Participants included 137 individuals who had experienced a traumatic event within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Participants completed four assessments over an approximate 1-year period that included clinician-administered measures for DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and SUD diagnosis and self-report measures of alcohol and drug use. Change over time in PTSD symptoms and substance use by diagnostic status were investigated using growth curve models. Temporal sequencing between PTSD symptom severity and substance use was investigated with bivariate latent difference score structural equation modeling. In line with the conceptualization of PTSD as a disorder of impeded recovery, having a diagnosis of PTSD at the final assessment moderated the trajectory of PTSD symptom severity such that symptom severity declined only among those without PTSD. In contrast, the influence of SUD appeared to be negligible. Both PTSD and SUD diagnoses were associated with initial drug use frequency. However, the relationship between alcohol use and diagnostic status did not reach statistical significance. Regarding temporal relationships between PTSD symptoms and substance use, significant and negative PTSD to change in substance use cross-lagged paths were found across most of the models, while only one significant substance use to change in PTSD severity crosslagged path emerged in the PTSD intrusion with alcohol use model. These results add to a growing body of research suggesting trauma-focused intervention is viable for individuals with PTSD/SUD. Further, examination of potential mediators and moderators of the relation between PTSD and SUD is recommended as a critical focus for future research.",255

An important task is to determine whether the ITQ is an appropriate evaluative measure for clinical trials. Objective: To assess the psychometric properties of the ITQ in the context of treatment and determine if the ITQ measures reliable and clinically significant change over the course of a psychosocial intervention. Method: Analyses were based on data from an online skills training programme delivered to 254 U.S. Veterans. Reliability and validity of the ITQ scores were assessed at baseline. Changes in symptom scores and probable diagnostic rates were compared at pre-, mid- and post-treatment. A reliable change index (RCI) score was computed to classify participants as improved, unchanged, or worsened. The PCL-5 was used as a comparison measure. Results: Baseline concurrent and factorial validity was similar to previous studies. Internal consistency at each assessment was excellent and comparable to the PCL-5. Decline in symptoms from pre-to-post-treatment was significant for PTSD and CPTSD symptom profiles. Rate of probable disorder (PTSD or CPTSD) declined significantly from pre-treatment to post-treatment. Pre-to-post treatment declines exceeded the critical RCI values for the ITQ. Clinically significant changes were observed where most participants improved, some stayed the same, and few worsened. The performance of the ITQ was consistent with the PCL-5 regarding sensitivity to change. Conclusion: This study provides the first demonstration that the ITQ measures reliable and clinically significant treatment-related change of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD symptoms.Antecedentes: el Cuestionario Internacional de Trauma (ITQ por su sigla en inglés) es una medida validada que evalúa el trastorno por estrés postraumático (TEPT) y el TEPT complejo (TEPT-C) según la CIE-11. Una tarea importante es determinar si la ITQ es una medida de evaluación adecuada para los ensayos clínicos.Objetivo: Evaluar las propiedades psicométricas de la ITQ en el contexto del tratamiento y determinar si la ITQ mide un cambio confiable y clínicamente significativo durante el transcurso de una intervención psicosocial.Método: Los análisis se basaron en datos de un programa de entrenamiento de habilidades en línea entregado a 254 veteranos estadounidenses. La confiabilidad y la validez de las puntuaciones de ITQ se evaluaron al inicio del estudio. Se compararon los cambios en las puntuaciones de los síntomas y las tasas de diagnóstico probables antes, en la mitad y después del tratamiento. Se calculó una puntuación de índice de cambio confiable (RCI) para clasificar a los participantes como mejorados, sin cambios o empeorados. El PCL-5 se utilizó como medida de comparación.Resultados: La validez basal concurrente y factorial fue similar a estudios previos. La consistencia interna en cada evaluación fue excelente y comparable a la del PCL-5. La disminución de los síntomas de antes a después del tratamiento fue significativa para los perfiles de síntomas de TEPT TEPT-C. La tasa de trastorno probable (TEPT o TEPT-C) disminuyó significativamente desde el pretratamiento hasta el postratamiento. Las disminuciones antes-después del tratamiento excedieron los valores críticos de RCI para la ITQ. Se observaron cambios clínicamente significativos en los que la mayoría de los participantes mejoraron, algunos permanecieron igual y pocos empeoraron. El desempeño de la ITQ fue consistente con el PCL-5 con respecto a la sensibilidad al cambio.Conclusión: Este estudio proporciona la primera demostración de que la ITQ mide cambios confiables y clínicamente significativos relacionados con el tratamiento de los síntomas de TEPT y TEPT-C de la CIE-11.背景: 国际创伤问卷 (ITQ) 是一个经过验证的评估ICD-11创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 和复杂性PTSD (CPTSD) 的测量工具。一项重要的任务是确定ITQ是否适合用于临床试验。目的: 在治疗的背景下评估ITQ的心理测量特性, 并确定ITQ是否测量出可靠且具有临床意义的社会心理干预过程中的变化。方法: 分析基于来自一项提供给254名美国退伍军人的在线技能培训计划的数据。在基线时评估了ITQ得分的信度和效度。在治疗前, 中, 后比较症状得分的变化和可能的诊断率。计算了一个可靠的变化指数 (RCI) 分数, 以将参与者分为改善, 不变或恶化。 PCL-5用作对比测量。结果: 基线的同时和因素效度与前人研究相似。每次评估的内部一致性都非常好, 可与PCL-5相媲美。对于PTSD和CPTSD症状, 治疗前后症状的下降是显著的。从治疗前到治疗后, 可能的发病率 (PTSD或CPTSD) 显著下降。治疗前后下降幅度超过了ITQ的关键RCI值。观察到了临床上显著的变化, 大多数参与者有所改善, 一些参与者保持不变, 很少恶化。 ITQ在对改变的敏感性上的表现与PCL-5一致。结论: 本研究首次证明了ITQ可测量ICD-11 PTSD和CPTSD症状的可靠且临床显著的治疗相关变化。.",257

Before administering the survey, the PCL-5 was translated into Italian according to the back-translation method. The factorial structure of the PCL-5 was assessed through multiple confirmatory factor analyses. Gender measurement invariance and concurrent and criterion validity were also evaluated.The instrument had a seven-factor structure and it worked in a similar manner for males and females. With regard to the concurrent validity, results showed that higher PCL-5 scores were associated with higher levels of depression and rumination and lower levels of life satisfaction. Regarding criterion validity, results revealed that PCL-5 scores were, on average, higher for females than for males, and the temporal distance from the traumatic event was negatively correlated with the total PCL-5 score.The findings indicated that the Italian version of the PCL-5 was able to provide valid and reliable scores for the assessment of PTSD symptoms in the Italian population.",258
https://openalex.org/W2612925317,10.1089/neu.2016.4842,Trajectories and Risk Factors for Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms following Pediatric Concussion,"A substantial minority of children experience post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following injury. Research indicates variation in the trajectory of PTSS following pediatric injury, but investigation of PTSS following concussion has assumed homogeneity. This study aimed to identify differential trajectories of PTSS following pediatric concussion and to investigate risk factors, including acute post-concussive symptoms (PCS), associated with these trajectories. A total of 120 children ages 8–18 years reported PTSS for 3 months following concussion diagnosis using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale, with a score of 16 or above indicating probable post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Age, gender, injury mechanism, loss of consciousness, previous concussions, prior hospitalization, prior diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and acute PCS were assessed as risk factors. Data were analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling. Results revealed 16% of children had clinically significant PTSS 2 weeks post-concussion, declining to 10% at 1 month and 6% at 3 months post-injury. Group-based trajectory modeling identified three trajectories of PTSS post-concussion: “resilient” (70%); “recovering” (25%), in which children experienced elevated acute symptoms that declined over time; and “chronic symptomatology” (5%). Due to small size, the chronic group should be interpreted with caution. Higher acute PCS and prior diagnosis of depression or anxiety both significantly increased predicted probability of recovering trajectory group membership. These findings establish that most children are resilient to PTSS following concussion, but that PTSS do occur acutely in a substantial minority of children. The study indicates mental health factors, particularly PTSS, depression, and anxiety, should be considered integral to models of concussion management and treatment.",259

The present study is the first to test the factorial structure and measurement invariance of the HTQ according to DSM-5 criteria across gender and ethnic groups in the ethnically diverse society of post-conflict Sri Lanka. The survey sample included 5136 participants (86% response rate) followed up 12 months after a baseline nationally representative survey undertaken in Sri Lanka in 2014. Exposure to conflict-related traumatic experiences (TEs) generating a trauma count (TC), and symptoms of PTSD were assessed using a modified version of the HTQ adapted to the local context. The final analytic sample included 4260 participants after excluding records with missing data on key variables. We conducted Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MG-CFA) to test the four-factor (DSM-5 consistent) and three-factor (DSM-IV-TR) models of PTSD, then assessing measurement invariance of the four factor model by gender and ethnic groups. The three-factor and four-factor DSM-5 model each produced a good fit across the sample as a whole. In addition, there was configural, metric, and scalar invariance for the four-factor model both by gender and ethnicity. The trauma count was directly associated with each of the symptom domains of the four factor model. Our findings provide support for the capacity of the modified HTQ to measure the DSM5 construct of PTSD across gender and key ethnic groupings in Sri Lanka. Confirmation of our findings in other cultures will be important.",260

The PTSD Checklist (assessing PTSD symptoms), GAD-7 scale (assessing GAD symptoms), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (assessing depression) were administered to 1266 trauma-exposed Ohio National Guard soldiers. Results indicated three discrete subgroups based on symptom patterns with mild (class 1), moderate (class 2) and severe (class 3) levels of symptomatology. Classes differed in symptom severity rather than symptom type. Income and education significantly predicted class 1 versus class 3 membership, and class 2 versus class 3.

Patients completed the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire with a Cognition bolt-on shortly after hospital admission, which included a recalled pre-injury measure, and, again, at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-burn. Burn severity was indicated by the number of surgeries, and PTSD symptoms were assessed with the IES-R at three months post-burn. Pre- and post-injury HRQL were compared to norm populations.Recalled pre-injury HRQL was higher than population norms and HRQL at 18 months post-burn was comparable to population norms. Compared to the pre-injury level of functioning, four HRQL patterns of change over time were established: Stable, Recovery, Deterioration, and Growth. In each HRQL domain, a subset of patients did not return to their recalled pre-injury levels, especially with regard to Pain, Anxiety/Depression, and Cognition. Patients with more severe burns or PTSD symptoms were less likely to return to pre-injury level of functioning within 18 months post-burn.This study identified four patterns of individual change. Patients with more severe injuries and PTSD symptoms were more at risk of not returning to their recalled pre-injury HRQL. This study supports the face validity of using a recalled pre-burn HRQL score as a reference point to monitor HRQL after burns.",263

This study aimed to estimate the magnitude of PTSD rate in mountain workers once we used a cover story to reduce sample bias. Mountain workers underwent either clinical interviews by means of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (n = 60) or they self-reported their symptoms by means of an appropriate questionnaire of the PTSD Check List (PCL) (n = 73). We also estimated the magnitude of PTSD rate by the means of meta-analysis. A discrepancy in the PTSD rate was observed as a function of the method used for the diagnosis [i.e., the interview method (22%) or the self-report method (5%)]. Furthermore, the meta-analysis shows that the overall estimation of PTSD varies and lies between 2.79% and 5.93% among this specific population with multiple exposures (range from 64% to 96% for exposure at least one TE). Our results are congruent with higher PTSD rates observed with other at-risk professionals. The present study reveals that mountains workers are frequently exposed to TE and according to the method of diagnosis the prevalence rate may present huge variations. This major finding points out the necessity to pay attention to the method used when the PTSD prevalence is estimated in the case of multiple exposure and among occupational population.",264

We provide a risk estimate tool allowing a calculation of individuals’ PTSD likelihood from early predictors. Members of the International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP) shared individual participants’ item‐level data from ten longitudinal studies of civilian trauma survivors admitted to acute care centers in six countries. Eligible participants (N=2,473) completed an initial clinical assessment within 60 days of trauma exposure, and at least one follow‐up assessment 4‐15 months later. The Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale for DSM‐IV (CAPS) evaluated PTSD symptom severity and diagnostic status at each assessment. Participants’ education, prior lifetime trauma exposure, marital status and socio‐economic status were assessed and harmonized across studies. The study's main outcome was the likelihood of a follow‐up PTSD given early predictors. The prevalence of follow‐up PTSD was 11.8% (9.2% for male participants and 16.4% for females). A logistic model using early PTSD symptom severity (initial CAPS total score) as a predictor produced remarkably accurate estimates of follow‐up PTSD (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.976). Adding respondents’ female gender, lower education, and exposure to prior interpersonal trauma to the model yielded higher PTSD likelihood estimates, with similar model accuracy (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.941). The current model could be adjusted for other traumatic circumstances and accommodate risk factors not captured by the ICPP (e.g., biological, social). In line with their use in general medicine, risk estimate models can inform clinical choices in psychiatry. It is hoped that quantifying individuals’ PTSD risk will be a first step towards systematic prevention of the disorder.",265

In this cross-sectional study, an ACE questionnaire and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) were completed by 147 participants ≤ 3 months after presenting to a Philadelphia, PA emergency department between 2014 and 2019 with a violent injury. This study treated ACEs, both separate and cumulative, as exposures and PTSD symptom severity as the outcome. Most participants (63.3%) met criteria for provisional PTSD, 90% reported experiencing ≥ 1 ACE, and 39% reported experiencing ≥ 6 ACEs. Specific ACEs were associated with increasing PCL-5 scores and increased risk for provisional PTSD. Additionally, as participants' cumulative ACE scores increased, their PCL-5 scores worsened (b = 0.16; p < 0.05), and incremental ACE score increases predicted increased odds for a positive provisional PTSD screen. Results provide further evidence that ACEs exacerbate the development of PTSD in young survivors of violence.

This report presents the results of analyses designed to create an optimal short-form PCL for DSM-5 (PCL-5) using both machine learning and conventional scale development methods. Methods The short-form scales were developed using independent datasets collected by the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience among Service members. We began by using a training dataset (n = 8,917) to fit short-form scales with between 1 and 8 items using different statistical methods (exploratory factor analysis, stepwise logistic regression, and a new machine learning method to find an optimal integer-scored short-form scale) to predict dichotomous PTSD diagnoses determined using the full PCL-5. A smaller subset of best short-form scales was then evaluated in an independent validation sample (n = 11,728) to select one optimal short-form scale based on multiple operating characteristics (area under curve [AUC], calibration, sensitivity, specificity, net benefit). Results Inspection of AUCs in the training sample and replication in the validation sample led to a focus on 4-item integer-scored short-form scales selected with stepwise regression. Brier scores in the validation sample showed that a number of these scales had comparable calibration (0.015–0.032) and AUC (0.984–0.994), but that one had consistently highest net benefit across a plausible range of decision thresholds. Conclusions The recommended 4-item integer-scored short-form PCL-5 generates diagnoses that closely parallel those of the full PCL-5, making it well-suited for screening.",268

Methods: Patients (n = 96) were examined within 48 h and 3 months after the illness episode. The brief revised illness perception questionnaire (Brief-IPQ) was used to assess patients' cognitive representation of their MI. At 3-month follow-up, the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were used to assess the level of PTSD symptoms. Results: The subjective perception of the illness, including higher harmful consequences (r > 0.35, p < 0.01), higher illness concerns (r > 0.24, p < 0.05) and more emotional impairment (r > 0.23, p < 0.05), was associated with both self-rated and clinician-rated PTSD symptoms. Beliefs regarding harmful consequences after acute MI were independently associated with levels of PTSD symptoms assessed with both the self-rated PDS and CAPS interview (standardized β coefficient = 0.24; P < 0.05) adjusted for demographic factors, cognitive depressive symptoms, fear of dying during MI, factors related to study design, and illness severity. Conclusions: The findings suggest that initial perception of acute MI is significantly associated with PTSD symptoms attributable to MI at 3 months follow-up.",270

Thus, timely, valid and reliable assessment of the symptoms of the disorder is crucial. The purpose of the study was the psychometric validation of The Child Revised Impact of Events Scale (CRIES 13), following the preceding linguistic validation. Further goal was to evaluate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children 6 to 14 years of age with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methods The questionnaire was consecutively administered to 175 parents coming to the Emergency Department of the Pediatric Hospital of Patras, after mTBI of their children. They were asked to respond one week and one month after the accident to assess PTSD of their children. For psychometric validation, exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analysis was performed. The questionnaire consists of 13 items rated on a non-linear scale ranging from 0 to 65, and higher scores indicate more PTSD symptoms with a threshold of 30. Results The Psychometric validation showed very good reliability (= 0.79) and EFA confirmed the factor structure of the original tool. In addition, CFA showed satisfactory fit for the three-factor model. Parents estimated post-traumatic stress one week after injury in 19% of the children. Statistically significant difference was observed only in monthly income, with parents of low income reporting higher levels of stress in their children (p = 0.046). Conclusions A reliable and valid questionnaire is now available in Greek for assessing the risk of PTSD in children. In one of five children presented in our hospital we observed a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress one week after mild traumatic brain injury. Key messages There is reliable and valid questionnaire in Greek for assessing the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder in children.",271

We examined the diagnostic accuracy of the Japanese version PCL‐Specific (PCL‐S) and the abbreviated versions of the PCL‐S among the evacuees of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Methods Fifty‐one participants were recruited from an evacuee and clinical sample. The PCL‐S, Impact of Event Scale‐Revised (IES‐R), and World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview were administered. Screening properties of the PCL‐S, IES‐R, and abbreviated PCL‐S against PTSD diagnosis, including sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic efficiency, were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn, and optimal cutoff points were examined. Results The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic efficiency of the PCL‐S were 66.7%, 84.9%, and 79.2%, respectively (at 52, the area under the curve was 0.83). The cutoff point method for the PCL‐S performed better than did the symptom cluster method. The screening properties of the abbreviated versions were comparable with those of the full version. Conclusions The Japanese version of the PCL‐S showed moderate diagnostic accuracy and improved performance over the IES‐R for PTSD diagnosis based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition. The Japanese version of the PCL‐S was a reliable and valid measure, and its diagnostic accuracy was reasonable for both full and abbreviated versions.",272

Materials and Methods: A total of 114 patients with PTSD (36 men and 78 women) were recruited and completed psychological assessments including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the scale for suicidal ideation, the clinician-administered PTSD scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition, the PTSD checklist, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the results. We developed a model including childhood physical abuse experience as the causal variable, suicidal ideation as a result variable, and PTSD and depression as mediation variables. PTSD symptoms were divided into four clusters [intrusion, avoidance, negative cognition and mood, and altered arousal and reactivity (hyperarousal)] to determine predictive power for suicide. Results: PTSD symptoms fully mediated the relationship between childhood physical abuse and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms fully mediated the relationship between childhood physical abuse and depression. Among the PTSD symptoms, hyperarousal was the only symptom cluster that mediated the relationship between childhood physical abuse and suicidal ideation. The symptom clusters of negative cognition and mood as well as hyperarousal mediated the relationship between childhood physical abuse and depression. Conclusions: This study presents a link between childhood physical abuse and current symptoms in patients with PTSD, and highlights specific PTSD symptom clusters (i.e., hyperarousal, negative cognition and mood) that may increase the risk for psychopathology later in life.",273

Five databases were searched through 29 April 2019. The purpose of this manuscript is to report a summary of this literature, the aggregate effect size of the relationship between PTSD and PTG, and the examination of potential moderators that may impact the relationship between PTSD and PTG.The aggregate weighted effect size for the association between PTSD/PTSS and PTG was small, r = .08, but significantly different from zero. We examined whether time since diagnosis, stage of cancer, type of measure used to assess PTSD/PTSS, or type of measure used to assess PTG explained the significant heterogeneity among the individual effect sizes. The relationship was significantly stronger for the small subset of studies that included only stage 4 patients compared with those that included only non-stage 4 patients. Additionally, the strongest relationship was for those studies that used the Impact of Events Scale-Revised to assess PTSD.The relationship between PTSD/PTSD and PTG is modestly positive and robust. There is evidence that the threat of advanced cancer is more strongly associated with growth, but none supporting that more time since cancer diagnosis allows survivors the opportunity to positively reinterpret and find meaning in the traumatic aspects of the disease resulting in more growth.",274

To evaluate this possibility, we examined symptom differences among older and younger individuals with PTSD and measured the frequency with which older adults receive standard of care treatment. Methods Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale for DSM (CAPS) scores were compared between younger and older adults with PTSD. Profiles were calculated for the most dominant CAPS symptom cluster reported by each participant, and the age cutoff best differentiating symptom clusters between individuals was determined. Clinical interview data (older adult sample only) were evaluated by trained raters to determine rates at which PTSD participants accessed treatment. Results Among 108 individuals with PTSD, 69% of participants &lt;67 years old had Criterion C (avoidance) symptoms as the most dominant cluster compared to 39% of participants ≥67 ( p = 0.016). Eight percent of participants &lt;67 years had Criterion E (hyperarousal) symptoms as the most dominant cluster compared to 30% of participants ≥67 ( p = 0.016). Less than 25% of the older adults (N = 53 subsample) were receiving a first‐line pharmacotherapy option for PTSD, and 0% of participants were currently participating in an evidence‐based psychotherapy for PTSD. Conclusions Clinicians evaluating patients should be aware that different symptom profiles may be present between younger and older adults with PTSD. Despite their high risk for adverse neuropsychiatric and other health consequences, older adults with PTSD appear to infrequently receive first‐line clinical treatment.",275

Family caregiver posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were measured using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised at four time points: at enrollment, shortly after ICU discharge, and at 3 and 6 months after ICU discharge. The data were examined using latent class growth analysis to identify posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories. Two distinct symptom trajectories were identified: a persistently high trajectory, characterized by high posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at initial assessment, which remained elevated over time, and a persistently low trajectory, characterized by low posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at initial assessment, which remained low over time. Approximately two-thirds of caregivers belonged to the persistently high trajectory, and one-third of caregivers belonged to the persistently low trajectory.Using latent class growth analysis to measure 6-month ICU family caregiver posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories, we identified two distinct trajectories (persistently low and persistently high). A larger cohort study is warranted to further delineate posttraumatic stress disorder trajectories in this population, with the ultimate goal of targeting high-risk caregivers for interventions to reduce psychologic distress and improve long-term caregiver outcomes.",276

Adverse childhood experience (ACE) can affect brain structure, which may contribute to development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after subsequent adult trauma. It is unclear, however, if ACE history is particularly associated with aspects of hypothalamic structure which contribute to development of PTSD. To address this issue, the present study longitudinally assessed hypothalamic volumes and their associations with ACE and early post-trauma stress symptoms in subjects who did or did not develop PTSD during 12 months after adult trauma. 109 subjects (18-60 years, F/M = 75/34) completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL) questionnaire for post-trauma stress symptoms, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) for ACE assessment, and an initial MRI brain scan for hypothalamic volume measurement, within 2 weeks after adult trauma. At post-trauma 12 months, subjects underwent a subsequent PTSD diagnosis interview using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and a follow-up MRI scan. Left and right hypothalamus volumes at 2 weeks after adult trauma negatively correlated with CTQ scores. Right hypothalamus volume at this early time mediated an association between ACE and PTSD symptoms 12 months later. Right hypothalamus volumes also remained persistently smaller from 2 weeks to 12 months after trauma in survivors who developed PTSD. These results suggest that smaller right hypothalamus volume may be related to ACE history in ways that contribute to PTSD development after trauma in adulthood.",277

In this study, we examined the association of parasympathetic activity during slow wave sleep (SWS) with self-reported hyperarousal measures in recently traumatized individuals. Methods Individuals exposed to a PTSD Criterion-A trauma within the past 2 years (N=76) aged 18-40 (mean 24.06, SD 4.76), of whom 43% met DSM-5 criteria for PTSD, underwent a night of ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) following an acclimation night. ECG recordings during SWS-sleep periods of at least 5 min were analyzed for 2 parasympathetic indices: Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences (RMSSD) and High Frequency (0.14-0.4Hz) power (HF power) using Kubios software. Hyperarousal indices included the hyperarousal items from the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) excluding the sleep item #20 (PCLhyp), those from the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) including sleep items (CAPShyp), as well as a published Hyperarousal Scale (HAS) and Hypervigilance Questionnaire (HVQ). In addition, a Composite Hyperarousal Index (CHI) was computed from combined hyperarousal items on the PCL-5 and the CAPS-5 as well as the HAS total score. Results SWS RMSSD was negatively associated with PCLhyp (R = -.244, p = 0.035), CAPShyp (R = -.250, p = 0.03), CHI (R = -.280, p = 0.014), and HAS (R = -.229, p = 0.049). SWS HF power was negatively associated with CHI (R = -.227, p = 0.049). Conclusion The hyperarousal (Criterion E) symptoms of PTSD are associated with lowered parasympathetic tone during SWS across the spectrum of posttraumatic severity from resilient individuals to those diagnosed with PTSD.

Measures of suicide attempt-related PTS (SA-PTS), suicidal ideation, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and outpatient medical and mental health utilization were completed at 1 and 3 months. A series of mixed-effects regression models were used to analyze the data.Greater SA-PTS at 1 month was associated with significantly greater suicidal ideation, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness across 1 and 3 months.Addressing PTS following a medically serious suicide attempt may aid in addressing suicide-specific constructs and improve the recovery trajectory following hospitalization.",279

PTSD is composed of 20 symptoms across four clusters. However, 20-item measures can be burdensome to administer frequently, especially in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) where multiple assessments are conducted per day. An abbreviated 8-item version of the PCL-5 was developed to obtain information about PTSD symptoms at reduced effort to the participant. However, the symptom severity scale by which symptoms can range between the abbreviated (0–32) and full (0–80) scales differ, which limits the interpretability of the abbreviated scale. The current study evaluated three different methods (a proportional, linear regression, and genetic programming model) to convert scores from the abbreviated measure to that of the full PCL. These equations were then compared across two testing samples to assess their accuracy and bias. The genetic programming and linear regression equation were superior to a proportional equation in both measures of accuracy and bias, with the genetic programming equation demonstrating less bias overall than the linear regression. Furthermore, the diagnostic utility of each method was found to be similar. These results provide a method to convert abbreviated PCL scores to that of the full scale, which increases the utility of this abbreviated scale.",280

Face-to-face psychiatric interviews were carried out with 342 participants to make a diagnosis of PTSD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria. A traumatic events list was administered to screen Criterion A traumatic experiences, and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was administered to assess the severity of PTSD. The prevalence of PTSD was 31.0% (n = 106). Among 86.8% of the refugees with PTSD, the CAPS score was at the level of severe and above. Female gender, total number of traumatic events, and age predicted the PTSD symptom severity. Married young women were the most affected group and violent loss of family members was the most frequent type of trauma among them. Given that the vast majority of Syrian refugees have already settled down in various towns of the country, those who were residing in camps possibly constituted an especially fragile subgroup. The participants represented a group with an extreme level of mass traumatization. Both future research and psychosocial services should address those with broken families as a potentially fragile subgroup among refugees.",281

The population for the present study was restricted to a subset of initial web responders of the 2019 survey cycle, randomly assigned to 1 of 4 survey groups. <h3>Exposures</h3> Each group received the<i>DSM-IV</i>and<i>DSM-5</i>PCL (PCL–Civilian [PCL-C] version and PCL for<i>DSM-5</i>[PCL-5]). PCL instruments were counterbalanced to control for order effects. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Survey data were used to assess PTSD (using the PCL-C and PCL-5), major depressive disorder (using the Patient Health Questionnaire), generalized anxiety (using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and problem drinking (using the Patient Health Questionnaire). Demographic and military characteristics included age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, service branch, pay grade, enrollment panel, and military service status. <h3>Results</h3> Among the 1921 participants (mean [SD] age, 50.1 [12.5] years), 1358 (70.7%) were men, 1638 (85.3%) were non-Hispanic White individuals, 1440 (75.0%) were married, and 1190 (61.9%) had at least a bachelor’s degree; 295 (15.4%) had probable PTSD according to<i>DSM-IV</i>criteria with PCL-C compared with 286 (14.9%) using<i>DSM-5</i>criteria with PCL-5 (κ = 0.77). There was substantial agreement between PCLs for probable PTSD based on<i>DSM-IV</i>criteria (295 [15.4%] with PCL-C; 316 [16.4%] with PCL-5; κ = 0.80) and<i>DSM-5</i>criteria (286 [14.9%] with PCL-5; 258 [13.4%] with PCL-C; κ = 0.77). Estimated PTSD sum scores showed excellent agreement with observed scores. Using an established crosswalk, PCL-5 sum scores estimated with the PCL-C were similar to observed PCL-5 scores. Of the 17 corresponding items between the 2 instruments, 16 had substantial agreement. Appending 2 additional PCL-C items to the PCL-5 did not significantly alter estimates. The PCL-C and PCL-5 had nearly identical associations with comorbid conditions. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that PTSD can be successfully assessed and compared over time with either PCL instrument in veteran and military populations.",282

Greater severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, specifically re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms, at baseline predicted Consistently Moderate and High and Increasing PTG trajectories. Compared to the Low and Decreasing PTG trajectory, the High and Increasing PTG trajectory scored higher on baseline measures of gratitude, purpose in life, Spirituality, and social support.Posttraumatic growth is a dynamic process with divergent trajectories. Developing interventions that target certain psychosocial factors may help trauma survivors maintain PTG over time.",283
https://openalex.org/W4321458431,10.1038/s41398-022-02298-x,Screening for PTSD and TBI in Veterans using Routine Clinical Laboratory Blood Tests,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder diagnosed by clinical interviews, self-report measures and neuropsychological testing. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have neuropsychiatric symptoms similar to PTSD. Diagnosing PTSD and TBI is challenging and more so for providers lacking specialized training facing time pressures in primary care and other general medical settings. Diagnosis relies heavily on patient self-report and patients frequently under-report or over-report their symptoms due to stigma or seeking compensation. We aimed to create objective diagnostic screening tests utilizing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) blood tests available in most clinical settings. CLIA blood test results were ascertained in 475 male veterans with and without PTSD and TBI following warzone exposure in Iraq or Afghanistan. Using random forest (RF) methods, four classification models were derived to predict PTSD and TBI status. CLIA features were selected utilizing a stepwise forward variable selection RF procedure. The AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.730, 0.706, 0.659, and 0.715, respectively for differentiating PTSD and healthy controls (HC), 0.704, 0.677, 0.671, and 0.681 for TBI vs. HC, 0.739, 0.742, 0.635, and 0.766 for PTSD comorbid with TBI vs HC, and 0.726, 0.723, 0.636, and 0.747 for PTSD vs. TBI. Comorbid alcohol abuse, major depressive disorder, and BMI are not confounders in these RF models. Markers of glucose metabolism and inflammation are among the most significant CLIA features in our models. Routine CLIA blood tests have the potential for discriminating PTSD and TBI cases from healthy controls and from each other. These findings hold promise for the development of accessible and low-cost biomarker tests as screening measures for PTSD and TBI in primary care and specialty settings.",284

Recently the PCL was updated according to the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. So far only a few studies have examined the psychometric properties of the PCL-5, and all of these are restricted to populations living in industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties and diagnostic utility of the PCL-5 as a screening instrument for war-affected displaced Kurdish and Arab populations. The specific goal was to determine a contextually valid cut-off score for a probable diagnosis of PTSD. The PCL-5 was translated into Arabic and two Kurdish dialects. Trained interviewers administered these translations as assisted self-reports to 206 adults living in camps for displaced people in Iraq, together with depression and war-exposure instruments. Two weeks later, 98 randomly chosen subjects were reassessed by expert clinical psychologists. In the absence of a gold-standard instrument with proven validity in this context, the expert interviewers applied the PCL-5 items in the form of a clinical interview and used a DSM-5-algorithm to determine a diagnosis of PTSD. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were performed to determine a valid cutoff-score. The internal consistency of the PCL-5 was high (alpha = .85) and the instrument showed an adequate convergent validity. Using the cut-off score of 23, the PCL-5 achieved the optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve = .82, p < .001; sensitivity = .82, specificity = .70). Given that the comparison of the two assessments included both a re-test interval and validation by different interviewers, our results indicate that the PCL-5 can be recommended as an assessment and screening instrument for Kurdish and Arab populations.",285

Factors that influence assessment are traumas that occurred long in the past, lower prevalence, the fact that older people complain less, more misinterpretation of avoiding and intrusion symptoms, more somatic comorbidity, and higher risk of cognitive impairment. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale is mostly used to diagnose PTSD, but is less researched in older individuals. Only two screening instruments have been validated specifically for older adults, the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and the Self-Rating Inventory for PTSD. The PCL scale has been used more often, has been translated in various languages, and is also suitable for clinician rating, which is considered more appropriate for older adults. The PCL-5, based on the new <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth</italic> Edition, criteria was researched in older veterans but needs further validation. Biological measures have not yet been adapted for assessment in the complex biological systems of older age.

Trajectories were identified using repeated measures latent class analysis (RMLCA). The risk profile was based on a ranking of importance of each characteristic using Cohen's d effect sizes and odds ratios. The impact of ASD and dissociation on PTSD was examined using logistic regression analyses.Altogether, 267 patients were included. The mean age was 54.0 (SD = 16.1) and 62% were men. The prevalence rate of ASD was approximately 21.7% at baseline, and 36.1% of trauma patients exhibited PTSD at 12 months after injury. Five trajectories were identified: (1) no PTSD symptoms, (2) mild, (3) moderate, (4) subclinical, and (5) severe PTSD symptoms. These trajectories seemed to remain stable over time. Compared with patients in other trajectories, patients with ASD and (subclinical) PTSD were younger and scored higher on anxiety, depressive symptoms, neuroticism, and trait anxiety. Regarding dissociation symptoms, inability to recall memories about the event was significantly more present than an altered sense of reality, (105 (40.7%) versus 56 (21.7%), p = .031), although that symptom had the strongest likelihood for PTSD. Patients with dissociation were significantly at risk for PTSD than patients without dissociation (OR = 4.82; 95%CI: 1.91-12.25).Psychological factors characterized ASD and trajectories of PTSD during 12 months post-trauma. Healthcare providers who are aware of these findings could early identify patients at risk for ASD and PTSD and refer them for patient-centred interventions.Antecedentes: El curso y las diferentes características del trastorno de estrés agudo y postraumático (TEA, TEPT) en poblaciones traumatizadas no están claros.Objetivo: Los objetivos fueron identificar las trayectorias longitudinales del TEPT, establecer un perfil de riesgo para el TEA y el TEPT basado en las características sociodemográficas, clínicas y psicológicas de los pacientes, y estudiar el efecto del TEA y la disociación en el TEPT durante los 12 meses posteriores al trauma.Método: Los pacientes completaron cuestionarios tras la inclusión y a los 3, 6, 9 y 12 meses después. Las trayectorias se identificaron mediante un análisis de clases latentes de medidas repetidas (RMLCA). El perfil de riesgo se basó en una clasificación de la importancia de cada característica utilizando los tamaños del efecto d de Cohen y cocientes de probabilidades (odds ratios). El impacto del TEA y la disociación en el TEPT se examinó mediante análisis de regresión logística.Resultados: En total, se incluyeron 267 pacientes. La edad media era de 54,0 (SD = 16,1) y el 62% eran hombres. La tasa de prevalencia de TEA fue de aproximadamente el 21,7% al inicio, y el 36,1% de los pacientes traumatizados presentaban TEPT a los 12 meses de la lesión. Se identificaron cinco trayectorias: (1) sin síntomas de TEPT, (2) leve, (3) moderada, (4) subclínica y (5) síntomas graves de TEPT. Estas trayectorias parecían permanecer estables a lo largo del tiempo. En comparación con los pacientes de otras trayectorias, los pacientes con TEA y TEPT (subclínico) eran más jóvenes y puntuaban más alto en ansiedad, síntomas depresivos, rasgos de neuroticismo y ansiedad. En cuanto a los síntomas de disociación, la incapacidad de recordar el suceso estaba significativamente más presente que la alteración del sentido de la realidad (105 (40,7%) frente a 56 (21,7%), p = 0,031), aunque este síntoma tenía la probabilidad más alta de TEPT. Los pacientes con disociación tenían un riesgo significativo de TEPT que los pacientes sin disociación (OR = 4,82; IC 95%: 1,91-12,25).Conclusiones: Los factores psicológicos caracterizaron el TEA y las trayectorias del TEPT durante los 12 meses posteriores al trauma. Los profesionales de la salud que conozcan estos hallazgos podrían identificar precozmente a los pacientes con riesgo de TEA y TEPT y remitirlos a intervenciones centradas en el paciente.背景: 创伤人群中急性和创伤后应激障碍 (ASD, PTSD) 的病程和不同特征尚不清楚。目的: 旨在确定 PTSD 的纵向轨迹, 根据患者的社会人口学, 临床和心理特征确定 ASD 和 PTSD 的风险剖面, 并研究 ASD 和解离对创伤后 12 个月内 PTSD 的影响。方法: 患者在被纳入后以及之后的 3, 6, 9 和 12 个月完成问卷。使用重复测量潜在类别分析 (RMLCA) 确定轨迹。风险剖面基于使用 Cohen’s d效应量和优势比对每个特征的重要性进行排序。使用逻辑回归分析考查 ASD 和解离对 PTSD 的影响。结果: 共纳入267 例患者。平均年龄为 54.0 (SD = 16.1), 62% 为男性。基线时 ASD 流行率约为 21.7%, 36.1% 的创伤患者在受伤后 12 个月时表现出 PTSD。确定了五个轨迹:(1) 无 PTSD 症状, (2) 轻度, (3) 中度, (4) 亚临床和 (5) 重度 PTSD 症状。随着时间的推移, 这些轨迹似乎保持稳定。与其他轨迹患者相比, 患有 ASD 和 (亚临床) PTSD 的患者更年轻, 在焦虑, 抑郁症状, 神经质和特质焦虑方面得分更高。关于解离症状, 无法回忆起事件相关记忆显著多于现实感改变 (105 (40.7%) 对 56 (21.7%), p = .031), 尽管这一症状最有可能发生 PTSD。与无解离患者相比, 有解离患者患 PTSD 的风险显著 (OR = 4.82; 95% CI:1.91-12.25)。结论: 心理因素表征了 ASD 和创伤后 12 个月内 PTSD 的轨迹。了解这些发现的医护提供者可以尽早识别出 ASD 和 PTSD 风险患者, 并为其提供以患者为中心的干预措施。.",287

Thus, the present study assessed the correlates of symptoms that persisted at 4 months after an ED visit and, in particular, evaluated the associations between these symptoms and self-reported stress levels at ED admission and discharge. This study was a prospective observational investigation conducted in the ED of Bordeaux University Hospital that included patients admitted for minor trauma. All participants were contacted by phone 4 months after presentation at the ED to assess the occurrence of post-concussion-like symptoms (PCLS). A total of 193 patients completed the follow-up assessment at 4 months; 5.2% of the participants suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 24.5% suffered from PCLS. A multivariate analysis revealed an association between PCLS and stress level at discharge from the ED (odds ratios [OR]: 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–7.40). The risk of PCLS at 4 months after an ED visit for a minor injury increased in association with the level of stress at discharge from the ED. These results may improve the quality of life for the millions of patients who experience a stressful injury event every year.",288

However, it has been pointed out that there is no clear dichotomy between the two models, and a combination of these two model could enable a better understanding of psychopathology. The recently proposed latent network model (LNM) has provided a statistical framework to enable this combination. Evidence has shown that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could be a suitable candidate disorder to study the combined model. In the current study, we initiated the first investigation of the latent network of PTSD symptoms.Methods The latent network of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms was estimated in 1196 adult survivors of China’s 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Validation testing of the latent network was conducted in a replication sample of children and adolescent who experienced various trauma types. PTSD symptoms were measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). The latent network was estimated using the seven-factor hybrid model of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, analysed using the R package lvnet.Results The latent network model demonstrated good fit in both samples. A strong weighted edge between the intrusion and avoidance dimensions was identified (regularized partial correlation = 0.75). The externalizing behaviour dimension demonstrated the highest centrality in the latent network.Conclusions This study is the first to investigate the latent network of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Results suggest that both latent symptom dimension and associations between the dimensions should be considered in future PTSD studies and clinical practices.",289

Methods: Participants included 432 adult patients referred for treatment to psychological, psychiatric disorders clinics and medical clinics of Shiraz, Iran. They were exposed to a traumatic event according to criterion A in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-V). Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Post-traumatic Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire - II (AAQ-II) and metacognitions questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30) all were applied for data collection. Results: The results indicated that childhood trauma has a direct correlation with symptoms of PTSD, metacognition, and time perspectives, while it has an indirect correlation with experiential avoidance as well as symptoms of PTSD. Thus, metacognition and time perspectives play a mediating role between childhood trauma and experiential avoidance. In the same way, all three variables (metacognition, time perspectives, and experiential avoidance) play the same role between childhood trauma and symptoms of PTSD. Conclusions: Altogether, results of this study were consistent with the metacognitive model as well as Time Perspective Theory for PTSD and emphasizes that childhood trauma, metacognition, time perspectives and experiential Avoidance are important in explanation of PTSD symptoms.Antecedentes: El presente estudio fue disenado para investigar los efectos directos e indirectos del trauma en la infancia, metacognicion, perspectivas de tiempo y evitacion experiencial como predictores de sintomas de trastorno de estres postraumatico (TEPT).Metodo: Los participantes incorporados fueron 432 pacientes adultos referidos para tratamiento psicologico, a las clinicas de trastornos psiquiatricos y medica de Shiraz, Iran. Ellos estuvieron expuestos a un evento traumatico segun el criterio A del Manual Diagnostico y Estadistico para Trastornos Mentales, quinta edicion (DSM-5). Para la recoleccion de la informacion se aplicaron el Cuestionario de Trauma Infantil (CTQ, por sus siglas en ingles), la lista de chequeo postraumatica del DSM-5 (PCL-5), el Inventario de Perspectiva de Tiempo de Zimbardo (ZTPI, por sus siglas en ingles), el Cuestionario de Aceptacion y Accion-ll (AAQ-II) y el Cuestionario de metacogniciones-30 (MCQ-30).Resultados: Los resultados indicaron que el trauma infantil tien una correlacion directa con sintomas de TEPT, metacognicion y perspectivas de tiempo, mientras que tiene una correlacion indirecta con evitacion experiencial y sintomas TEPT. De esta manera, la metacognicion y perspectivas de tiempo juegan un rol mediador entre trauma infantil y evitacion experiencial. De la misma forma, las tres variables (metacognicion, perspectivas de tiempo y evitacion experiencial) juegan el mismo rol entre trauma infantil y sintomas de TEPT.Comclusiones: En conjunto, los resultados de este estudio fueron consistentes con el modelo metacognitivo 25, así como la teoría de la perspectiva del tiempo para el TEPT y enfatiza que el trauma infantil, la metacognición, las perspectivas de tiempo y la evitación experiencial son importantes en la explicación de los síntomas de TEPT.背景：目前的研究旨在调查童年创伤，元认知，时间洞察力和经验性回避在预测创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）症状中的直接和间接影响。方法：被试包括432名成年患者，他们被转介到位于伊朗Shiraz的心理/精神障碍诊所和医疗诊所接受治疗。根据精神疾病诊断和统计手册第五版（DSM-V），他们曾暴露于标准A创伤事件。童年创伤问卷（CTQ），DSM-5的创伤后检查表（PCL-5），津巴多时间透视清单（ZTPI），接受和行动问卷-II（AAQ-II）和元认知调查表（MCQ-30）被用于数据收集。结果：结果表明童年创伤与PTSD症状、元认知和时间洞察力直接相关，而与经验性回避和PTSD症状间接相关。因此，元认知和时间洞察力在童年创伤和经验性回避之间起着中介作用。同样，所有三个变量（元认知，时间观点和经验避免）在童年创伤和创伤后应激障碍症状之间起着相同的作用。结论：总的来说，本研究的结果与创伤后应激障碍的元认知模型和时间洞察力理论一致，并强调童年创伤、元认知、时间洞察力和经验性回避对解释创伤后应激障碍症状的重要性。.",290

The article presents the results of adaptation and validation of the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) on a Russian sample. The questionnaire measures the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which can develop as a result of exposure to prolonged, repetitive traumatic experiences in the interpersonal sphere. Method. The study was carried out on a non-clinical sample, which included 429 participants who were 18 to 68 years old and who experienced at least one traumatic event in their lives. International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), LEC-5 (Life events checklist-5), author’s questionnaire “Emotional abuse”, Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were used in the study. Results. The structure of the questionnaire in the Russian-speaking sample confirmed the two-factor model of complex PTSD, which combines the symptoms of PTSD («Re-experiencing», «Avoidance», «Sense of Threat») and disturbances of Self-organization («Affective Dysregulation», «Negative Self-concept», «Disturbances in Relationships»). Internal consistency of the scale was in the acceptable range. Among those who have experienced at least one traumatic event, 20% met criteria for PTSD (11%) or CPTSD (9%). These data show that respondents with CPTSD have more intense psychopathological symptoms than respondents with PTSD; women show more intense symptoms of CPTSD than men.",291

Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) (5th ed.). Washington, DC: Author). DSM-5 introduced notable changes to PTSD criteria, and the structural impact of these changes is unclear. We conducted confirmatory factor analyses comparing seven commonly investigated or recently proposed PTSD models in a large sample of interviewed psychiatric outpatients reporting a Criterion A trauma (n = 310) or a sub-threshold (non-Criterion A) stressful life event (n = 284). A novel six-factor dysphoria model and recently proposed seven-factor hybrid model outperformed other models and fit the data equally well in both groups. Our results suggest equal fit for both models, although the six-factor model is more parsimonious. These results have implications for research regarding the mechanisms underlying and the treatments targeting PTSD.",292

Consequently, the objective of this study was to examine the influence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the sleep quality of family members whose loved ones were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Material and Methods: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study involved 120 participants (66 males and 54 females) who were first-degree relatives of trauma patients admitted to the ICU at 5th Azar Hospital in Gorgan. Within the first 24 hours of the trauma patient's admission to the ICU, one of their first-degree relatives completed the PCL-C questionnaire for assessing PTSD symptoms. If the participant obtained a score of 45 or higher on the PCL-C questionnaire, they were then requested to complete the Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 23 software. Results: The study found that the average score for PTSD among participants was 67.8 ± 5, indicating a high level of stress. The sleep quality score for family members of trauma patients upon hospitalization was 3.9 ± 1.8 (acceptable). However, one month later, their sleep quality significantly deteriorated to a score of 9.3 ± 2.5 (poor) (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant association found between sleep quality and PTSD (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The research findings indicate that the admission of a trauma patient to the ICU has a significant negative impact on the sleep quality of their family members. Although PTSD was prevalent among these individuals, it did not directly influence sleep quality. Nevertheless, addressing psychological issues and providing adequate psychological support are crucial for improving sleep quality and managing PTSD-related problems, especially for patients with severe complications.",293

Central to the focus of this study was the revision of PTSD's tripartite structure in DSM-IV into four symptom clusters in DSM-5. Emerging confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) studies have suggested that DSM-5 PTSD symptoms may be best represented by one of two 6-factor models: (1) an Externalizing Behaviors model characterized by a factor which combines the irritability/anger and self-destructive/reckless behavior items; and (2) an Anhedonia model characterized by items of loss of interest, detachment, and restricted affect. The current study conducted CFAs of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in two independent and diverse trauma-exposed samples of a nationally representative sample of 1484 U.S. veterans and a sample of 497 Midwestern U.S. university undergraduate students. Relative fits of the DSM-5 model, the DSM-5 Dysphoria model, the DSM-5 Dysphoric Arousal model, the two 6-factor models, and a newly proposed 7-factor Hybrid model, which consolidates the two 6-factor models, were evaluated. Results revealed that, in both samples, both 6-factor models provided significantly better fit than the 4-factor DSM-5 model, the DSM-5 Dysphoria model and the DSM-5 Dysphoric Arousal model. Further, the 7-factor Hybrid model, which incorporates key features of both 6-factor models and is comprised of re-experiencing, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing behaviors, and anxious and dysphoric arousal symptom clusters, provided superior fit to the data in both samples. Results are discussed in light of theoretical and empirical support for the latent structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms.",294

Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a brief transdiagnostic nontrauma focused intervention for people affected by adversity. This study reports on the capacity of PM+ to address specific symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Individual patient data from three randomised controlled trials were combined and analysed to observe the impacts of PM+ (n = 738) or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) (n = 742) interventions on specific PTSD symptoms at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. The PTSD-Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to index PTSD symptoms, and presence of each symptom was defined as moderate severity (score ≥ 2 on individual items).The average PCL-5 score at baseline was 26.1 (SD: 16.8) with 463 (31.3%) scoring above 33, indicative of a diagnosis of PTSD. Following intervention, 12.5% and 5.8% of participants retained a score greater than 33 at postassessment and follow-up, respectively. There was greater symptom reduction for PM+ than for ETAU for most symptoms. Hyperarousal symptoms were the most common residual symptoms after PM+, with more than 30% of participants reporting persistent sleep disturbance, concentration difficulties, and anger.PM+ led to greater reduction in symptoms relating to re-experiencing and avoidance. The evidence indicates that strategies focusing on hyperarousal symptoms including sleep, concentration, and anger difficulties, could be strengthened in this brief intervention.",295

Purpose: The purposes of this study were twofold: 1) to determine if physical therapy students develop or experience a worsening of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during exposure to and dissection of human cadavers; and 2) to determine if these symptoms are related to academic performance. Methods: Previous history of a diagnosis of anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder and level of prior exposure to cadavers were recorded among 26 entry-level first semester doctoral students in physical therapy (DPT) taking gross human anatomy. Their level of anxiety about working with cadavers before and after the course was recorded. The Life Events Checklist (LEC-5) for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) was used as a self-report measure to record potentially traumatic events in a subject’s life prior to the study and during the course. Subjects also completed the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) at the beginning and end of the course to assess for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Student performance was assessed using written and practical examination grades. Results: Overall, the PCL-5 score for the group decreased significantly over the semester (p = 0.01). However, 3 subjects’ PCL-5 scores increased. Risk factors present among these subjects included previous diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety, combat exposure, history of physical or sexual abuse, lack of previous exposure to cadavers, and coinciding traumatic events. Written examination performance was not significantly related to either change in PCL-5 (p = 0.84) or post-PCL-5 (p = 0.69) scores. Practical examination performance was not significantly related to either change in PCL-5 (p = 0.28) or post-PCL-5 (p = 0.51) scores. However, consistent with previous research, students with a history of post-traumatic stress disorder and/or anxiety did have statistically significant lower written examination scores. Conclusions: Physical therapy students neither developed nor experienced a worsening of, but rather a reduction in, PTSD symptoms during exposure to and dissection of human cadavers. Overall, symptoms of PTSD did not seem to be related to academic performance.",296
https://openalex.org/W2943398443,10.33151/ajp.16.681,Measuring Trauma Symptoms in Paramedicine,"Background The trauma experienced as a paramedic can have a devastating psychological impact on both professionals and students in training, and increases the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Paramedics are often placed in high-risk situations involving multiple or sustained trauma and also experience high levels of occupational stress, which can produce adverse psychological and physiological responses. Despite these risks, understanding trauma and its various manifestations in paramedicine has not been well documented. Methods This narrative review describes the history and changes in diagnostic criteria, and contrasts the methods of measuring PTSD symptomology with the current criteria. Results PTSD was first defined in the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-III) in 1980, however the diagnostic criteria and associated measurement tools failed to reflect the repeated and vicarious traumatic events experienced by paramedics. Currently, the majority of the measurement tools used to assess post-traumatic stress are still aligned with superseded diagnostic criteria and many only classify the symptoms of PTSD as present or absent with little consideration given to symptom severity. Consequently, these existing measurements of PTSD are out dated and inefficient in their ability to identify and measure PTSD using the revised criteria. Conclusion The development of a more specific measurement tool, which reflects the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of trauma-related stressors within this population, will allow for a more comprehensive measurement of symptoms. Future research undertaken in this specific field will also help to inform education and training programs to assist with the negative impacts of trauma and aid in management and treatment of PTSD in paramedics.",297

A post-burn baseline interview was conducted 6 months after the event, followed by annual surveys for three years.The burn survivors received structured assessment through telephone in the four-wave interviews, including the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5); two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2); four-item Startle, Physiological Arousal, Anger, and Numbness Scale (SPAN-4); and six-item Impact of Event Scale (IES-6) alongside demographic data and other health-related assessment.A total of 180 respondents with the mean age of 23 years old completed the four waves of interview. Using the BSRS-5 as the outcome, each variable had different input in psychological distress during the follow-up years. The main finding was that the SPAN-4 score could predict more than 62% of psychological distress between 6 months and 3 years after the disaster. The generalized estimating equation demonstrated that SPAN-4, IES-6, family functioning impairment, hypnotics use, adaptation to the event, and PHQ-2 could predict psychological distress. However, the variable of follow-up year did not exemplify significant estimation in the model.The results indicated that different factors had various influences on psychological distress across the four follow-up stages. PTSD-like symptoms, depression, and anxiety were the most common psychological problems experienced by the young burn cohort in the longitudinal post-traumatic period.Healthcare providers should be aware of psychological consequences of traumatic events within up to a 3-year post-burn period, particularly post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms.",299

This study explored the ability of the ITSS to predict chronic distress after injury, as well as the impact of combining the ITSS with an additional screening measure. METHODS Patients were enrolled following admission to a Level I trauma center. Baseline measurements were collected during initial hospitalization, and follow-up measures were collected an average of 6.5 months after injury. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were run to determine predictive accuracy, controlling for participants who had mental health intervention and for those who experienced additional potentially psychologically traumatic events since their injury event. RESULTS Utilizing a cut score of 2, the ITSS PTSD scale had a sensitivity of 85.42%, specificity of 67.35%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 91.9% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 51.4%. The combined PTSD risk group (risk positive on the baseline ITSS and the PTSD checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition) had a sensitivity of 72.92%, specificity of 81.63%, NPV of 88.2%, and PPV of 61.6%. Also using a cut score of 2, the ITSS Depression Scale had a sensitivity of 72.50%, specificity of 70.29%, NPV of 91.1%, and PPV of 37.9%. CONCLUSION The nine-item ITSS, which takes approximately 5 minutes to administer, is a stable screening tool for predicting those most at risk for PTSD and/or depression 6 months after admission to a Level I trauma center following traumatic injury. The combined PTSD risk group data provide evidence that symptom evaluation by a psychologist can improve specificity. These results further inform the recommendation of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma regarding PTSD and depression screening in trauma centers.

Methods Study patients were screened for PTSD using the PCL-5 checklist for DSM-5. Patient-reported quality of life and pain scores were assessed using validated tools (HerQLes and PROMIS Pain Intensity 3a survey). Results The prevalence of PTSD in 131 patients was 32.1% [95% CI 24%–40%]. Patients screening positive (PTSD+) reported lower quality of life scores on HerQles (17.3 ± 14.3 vs. 47.7 ± 29.6, P < 0.001), and higher pain scores on the PROMIS scale (54.2 ± 9.1 vs. 44.2 ± 10, p < 0.001). PTSD + patients also reported significantly higher numbers of previous hernia repairs and abdominal operations, as well as a higher rate of a history of an open abdomen. Conclusion Our study found a significant prevalence of positive screening for PTSD in patients seeking consultation regarding an incisional hernia. We have begun routine preoperative evaluations by a behavioral medicine specialist to address some of these complex issues in high-risk patients. Other high volume hernia programs caring for this challenging patient population should consider such assessments.",301

This pilot study evaluated its use and psychometric properties in an outpatient setting that provides treatment to survivors of chronic interpersonal trauma. Thirty participants completed self-report measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, dissociation, self-esteem, and affect dysregulation; the participants also participated separately in a semistructured interview based on the SOTS conducted by 2 trained interviewers. SOTS composite severity scores for DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (cPTSD), DSM-5 PTSD, and PTSD dissociative subtype, and total traumatic stress symptoms generally had acceptable internal consistency and interrater reliability. Evidence of convergent, discriminant, criterion, and construct validity was found for the SOTS composite PTSD scores, although potential limitations to validity that require further research and refinement of the measure were identified for the SOTS total and DSM-IV cPTSD scores and the hyperarousal, affect dysregulation, and dissociation items. Interviewers and interviewees described the interview as efficient, informative, and well tolerated. Implications for clinical practice and research to refine the SOTS are discussed.",302

This is understandable in light of the complexity of traumatic stressors, the risk and protective factors that influence the likelihood of developing traumatic stress disorders, and the several types of traumatic stress disorders in addition to PTSD and comorbid disorders and problems. Psychological trauma and PTSD, as defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5th edition), require the presence of events that are objectively “traumatic” and a menu of symptoms that include ones closely tied to memories of those events, reactions to and avoidance of those memories or reminders of those or similar events, persistent negative alterations in emotions, beliefs, and mental acuity, and problems with excessive or insufficient physical arousal affecting sleep, ability to manage impulses and anger, and observational measures that address each of these components in order to accurately determine if traumatic events have occurred and symptoms are sufficiently impairing to constitute a serious problem for the individual.",303

However, the dissociative subtype has not been assessed in a community sample in relation to the revised DSM-5 PTSD criteria. Moreover, the 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) currently does not assess depersonalization and derealization.MethodWe therefore evaluated two items for assessing depersonalization and derealization in 557 participants recruited online who endorsed PTSD symptoms of at least moderate severity on the PCL-5.ResultsA five-class solution identified two PTSD classes who endorsed dissociative experiences associated with either 1) severe or 2) moderate PTSD symptom severity (D-PTSD classes). Those in the severe dissociative class were particularly likely to endorse histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse. A principal axis factor analysis of the symptom list identified six latent variables: 1) Reexperiencing, 2) Emotional Numbing/Anhedonia, 3) Dissociation, 4) Negative Alterations in Cognition & Mood, 5) Avoidance, and 6) Hyperarousal.ConclusionsThe present results further support the presence of a dissociative subtype within the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD.",304

Method Participants aged 12–18 (n = 440) who reported to clinic within 14 days of concussion sustained in either sport injury, MVA, fall, or hit were selected from the ConTex registry. A PCS log, PHQ-8, and GAD-7 were completed at initial visit and 3-month follow-up. Separate hierarchical linear regressions determined predictors of PCS scores at both time points. Demographic, premorbid, injury, and psychological factors were entered in Step 1–4, respectively. A sample subset completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) at initial (n = 58) and 3-month visits (n = 27). Exploratory analyses added the PCL-5 to determine whether post-traumatic stress symptoms contributed to the model. Results At initial visit, sex, post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), PHQ-8, and GAD-7 significantly predicted PCS total scores (p &amp;lt; .001), accounting for 43% of the variance. At 3-month follow-up, PTA dropped out of the model, and psychiatric history and mechanism of injury became significant, explaining an additional 15% of the variance in PCS scores (R2 = .58, p &amp;lt; .001). In exploratory analyses, when PCL-5 scores were added to the final models, demographic, premorbid, and injury factors did not remain significant, and the PCL-5 significantly contributed to the variance in PCS scores at both initial (p = .01) and 3-month follow-up (p &amp;lt; .001). Conclusions Psychological stress and context of injury may be strong predictors of PCS in addition to demographic and premorbid factors. These findings warrant continued investigation of less explored injury factors contribution to initial mTBI presentation and recovery.",305

Confirmatory Factor Models Since <i>DSM–5</i>,"For over three decades confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) has been used to test the construct validity of models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The four symptom dimensions of PTSD in the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM–5) are based on CFA. Since the publication of DSM–5, the number of proposed factors has grown from four to seven. We review these models, focusing on (a) the number of symptoms per factor, indicating how well factors are identified; (b) correlations between factors, indicating how distinct they are; and (c) their external validation. Of the 27 CFAs published since 2013, almost all included factors composed of only two symptoms, and most relied on more than one. High factor correlations were the norm. Two thirds of models provided external validation. Discussion concerns implications for PTSD’s measurement and construct validity and recommendations for improving CFA in the PTSD literature.",306

The correct diagnosis of such disorders is not always a trivial task, sometimes forcing an individual to consult with many clinicians and performing several medical exams. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a disorder related to experienced events, which presented a certain degree of threat to an individual. When experiencing situations that refer to past events, an individual may present reactions that trigger physiological changes in the organism such as tachycardia or bradycardia. Many disorders have common symptoms, and identifying these subtleties results in greater diagnosis efficiency and effectiveness. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Mining (DM) techniques have helped specialists in the diagnosis and prevention of diseases and disorders. In our research, we aim at finding new biomarkers to diagnose PTSD analyzing physiological signals with DM techniques. In this paper, we used a dataset from an experiment with civilians that were recently exposed to traumatic events related to violence. Those individuals completed a questionnaire that evaluates the impact of such events through PCL (PTSD Disorder Checklist for DSM-IV) scale. Heart rate and skin conductance signals were collected while viewing emotional and neutral stimuli images. We applied DM techniques and classification algorithms to evaluate and maximize PCL score prediction performance considering those physiological signal data. The best result was obtained with SMO algorithm with its hyperparameters values suggested by an auto-learning procedure, presenting an accuracy of 85.45% (p-value = 0.001), precision of 0.8 (p-value = 0.001), recall of 0.5714 and F-Measure of 0.6667 (p-value = 0.001).",307

Method: DSM-IV and DSM-5 versions of the PTSD Checklist were included in follow-up interviews of physically injured patients enrolled longitudinally in a pragmatic clinical trial; pragmatic trials aim to efficiently implement research procedures to inform healthcare system policy changes. Psychometric comparisons of the DSM-IV, DSM-5, and a 20-item blended version of the scale included evaluations of internal consistency, correlational assessments, evaluation of item level agreements, and estimation of DSM-5 cutoffs that optimize electronic health record screening protocols. Results: 128 patients were included in the pragmatic psychometric study. Cronbach's alphas for the 3 versions of the PTSD Checklist ranged from 0.93 to 0.95. Correlations between the 3 scales ranged from 0.79 to 0.99. All 3 measures demonstrated excellent convergent and discriminant properties. Item level agreement ranged from 70-80%. For the DSM-5 and blended versions of the scale, a score of 30 and 24, respectively, best approximated the DSM-IV cutoff of ≥35 that had previously optimized PTSD detection in conjunction with EHR screening. Conclusions: Among injured trauma survivors, the psychometric performance of the DSM-IV PTSD Checklist with the addition of the 4 new DSM-5 PTSD Checklist items is nearly equivalent to the DSM-5 PTSD Checklist. The investigation also suggests that pragmatic psychometric methods can catalyze the rapid translation of research findings into real-world practice settings.",308

This study evaluated whether the level of symptom clusters at clinic intake contribute to poor mental health recovery in concussed patients during treatment, which may in turn serve as a target intervention. Objective The objective of this study is to examine the association between the level of initial symptoms and mental health symptoms among service members with concussion. Methods Data were obtained from 483 active duty service members treated in interdisciplinary treatment programs for traumatic brain injury, all of which were concussions. Pre-treatment symptom clusters included self-reported hyperarousal, dissociation/depression, cognitive dysfunction/headache and neurological symptoms. The outcomes, clinically-relevant decreases in depressive symptoms (assessed by the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-8) and PTSD symptoms (assessed by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, PCL-5), were defined as a decrease in PHQ-8 &amp;gt; 5 and PCL-5 &amp;gt; 7, respectively. Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to evaluate the relationship between the level of each symptom cluster and clinically-relevant decrease in outcomes. Results Participants with higher (vs. lower) levels of pre-treatment hyperarousal and dissociation/depression symptom cluster were less likely to improve in depressive and PTSD symptoms during treatment. The level of cognitive/headache and neurological symptom clusters were not significantly associated with any symptom changes. Conclusion These findings support the need for individualized treatment for symptoms identified and treated after determining concussion history, with particular attention to high levels of hyperarousal and dissociation/depression prior to treatment.",309

Logistic regression analyses assessed the association between depression, anxiety, and PTSD and HRQoL, health care utilization, and RTW.At six months post-injury, 22% (n = 665/3060) of included patients had scores indicative of probable anxiety disorder (14%), depression (16%), and/or PTSD (6%). These patients had reduced EQ-5D utility scores [β: -0.26 (95% CI: -0.28, -0.23)] and were less likely to RTW [OR: 2.12 (95% CI: 1.34, 3.37)] compared to their counterparts. Both mental and physical health care utilization were significantly higher in patients with symptoms indicative of depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD.In injury patients, there is a high occurrence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, which is associated with lower HRQoL, higher health care utilization, and lower RTW rates. These results underline the importance of screening and treatment of these symptoms in this population to enhance good recovery of injury patients.Antecedentes: Los pacientes lesionados se encuentran en riesgo de desarrollar problemas de salud mental, los cuales podrían resultar en recuperación más lenta y podrían afectar la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud (HRQoL en sus siglas en inglés), la utilización de los servicios de salud, y el retorno al trabajo (RTW en sus siglas en inglés).Objetivo: En este estudio, determinamos la prevalencia de síntomas indicativos de probable depresión, ansiedad y de trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) y su asociación con la HRQoL, con la utilización de servicios de salud, y el RTW en pacientes adultos lesionados.Método: Se recuperaron datos de pacientes adultos con lesiones no intencionales desde el Sistema Holandés de Vigilancia de Lesiones (DISS) y desde un cuestionario a los seis meses de seguimiento que incluyó la Escala Hospitalaria de Ansiedad y Depresión (HADS) y la Escala -revisada- del Impacto del Evento (IES-R) para evaluar síntomas de depresión, ansiedad y estrés postraumático (TEPT), también ítems sobre HRQoL (medida con la escala EQ-5D-5 L y la escala visual análoga EQ), utilización de servicios de salud, y RTW. Se aplicó análisis de regresión logística para evaluar la asociación entre depresión, ansiedad y TEPT y la HRQoL, utilización de servicios de salud y RWT.Resultados: A los 6 meses de seguimiento tras la lesión, el 22% (n = 665/3060) de los pacientes incluidos tuvo puntajes indicativos de probable trastorno de ansiedad (14%), depresión (16%) y/o TEPT (6%). Estos pacientes habían reducido los puntajes de la escala EQ-5D [β: −0.26 (95% CI: −0.28,-0.23)] y tuvieron menos probabilidad de RTW [OR: 2.12 (95% CI: 1.34, 3.37)] comparados con su contraparte. La utilización de servicios de salud tanto física como mental fue significativamente más alta en los pacientes con síntomas indicativos de depresión, ansiedad y/o TEPT.Conclusiones: En los pacientes lesionados, existe una alta incidencia de depresión, ansiedad y síntomas de TEPT, los cuales se asociaron con una menor HRQoL, mayor uso de servicios de salud, y menores tasas de RTW.

Embedded measures are indices within self‐report measures. To date, no embedded SVTs have been identified in the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5). This research aimed to develop and validate PCL‐5 SVTs in two samples of veterans. Participants completed one of two prospective research studies that included cognitive and psychological tests. Participants in Study 1 were veterans ( N = 464) who served following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; participants in Study 2 were veterans or service members ( N = 338) who had been deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. Both studies included the PCL‐5 and the Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS), the latter of which served as the criterion for identifying PCL‐5 SVTs. For Study 1, two separate SVTs were developed: the PCL‐5 Symptom Severity scale (PSS), based on the PCL‐5 total score, and the PCL‐5 Rare Items scale (PRI), based on PCL‐5 items infrequently endorsed at the highest item ratings. At the most conservative SIMS cutoff score, the PSS achieved excellent discrimination for both the Study 1, AUC = .840, and Study 2 samples, AUC = .858, with specific cutoff scores of ≥ 51 and ≥ 56 maximizing sensitivity while maintaining a specificity of .90. The PRI achieved good discrimination, AUCs = .760 and.726, respectively, with a cutoff score of 2 or higher indicated by both studies. The results of these two studies provide provisional support for these two embedded SVTs in the PCL‐5.",311

However, prior findings may not reflect the complete picture of distress postloss, because they were focused on depression symptoms following nonviolent death. We examined trajectories of symptom-levels of persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a disaster-bereaved sample. We also investigated associations among these trajectories and background and loss-related factors, psychological support, and previous mental health complaints. Methods Latent class growth modeling was used to identify distinct trajectories of PCBD, depression, and PTSD symptoms in people who lost loved ones in a plane disaster in 2014. Participants (N = 172) completed questionnaires for PCBD, depression, and PTSD at 11, 22, 31, and 42 months postdisaster. Associations among class membership and background and loss-related variables, psychological support, and previous mental health complaints were examined using logistic regression analyses. Results Two PCBD classes emerged: mild (81.8%) and chronic (18.2%) PCBD. For both depression and PTSD, three classes emerged: mild (85.6% and 85.2%), recovered (8.2% and 4.4%), and chronic trajectory (6.2% and 10.3%). People assigned to the chronic PCBD, depression, or PTSD class were less highly educated than people assigned to the mild/recovered classes. Conclusions This is the first latent trajectory study that offers insights in individual differences in longitudinal symptom profiles of PCBD, depression, and PTSD in bereaved people. We found support for differential trajectories and predictors across the outcomes.",312

https://openalex.org/W2886047269,10.1037/abn0000368,Examination of posttraumatic stress disorder symptom networks using clinician-rated and patient-rated data.,"Network theory, which conceptualizes psychiatric disorders as networks of interacting symptoms, may provide a useful framework for understanding psychopathology. However, questions have arisen regarding the stability and generalizability of network analytic methods, with some researchers arguing that symptom networks have limited replicability. The aim of this study was to evaluate assessment modality as one possible source of instability in the estimation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom networks. We estimated two cross-sectional DSM-5 PTSD symptom networks in 378 U.S. veterans: one using data from a clinician-rated assessment instrument (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5; CAPS-5) and one using data from a self-rated questionnaire (the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5). We calculated centrality indices, conducted community structure analyses, and compared the strength and structure of the networks. The CAPS-5 and PCL-5 symptom networks were highly similar, challenging the notion that network methods produce unreliable results due to estimations consisting primarily of measurement error. Furthermore, each network contained distinct symptom communities that only partially overlapped with the DSM-5 PTSD symptom clusters. These findings may provide guidance for future revisions of the DSM, suggest hypotheses about how PTSD symptoms interact, and inform recent debate about replicability of psychopathology symptom networks.

https://openalex.org/W3208090913,,"DSM-5-TR prolonged grief disorder and DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder are related, yet distinct: Confirmatory factor analyses in traumatically bereaved people","Background: Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is newly included in the text revision of the DSM-5 (DSM-5-TR). So far, it is unknown if DSM-5-TR PGD is distinguishable from bereavement-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prior research examining the distinctiveness of PTSD and pathological grief focused on non-traumatic loss samples, used outdated conceptualizations of grief disorders, and has provided mixed results. Objective: In a large sample of traumatically bereaved people, we first evaluated the factor structure of PTSD and PGD separately and then evaluated the factor structure when combining PTSD and PGD symptoms to examine the distinctiveness between the two syndromes. Methods: Self-reported data were used from 468 people bereaved due to the MH17 plane disaster (N = 200) or a traffic accident (N = 268). The 10 DSM-5-TR PGD symptoms were assessed with the Traumatic Grief Inventory-Self Report Plus (TGI-SR+). The 20-item Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to tap PTSD symptoms. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Results: For PTSD, a seven factor, so-called ‘Hybrid’ model yielded the best fit. For PGD, a univariate factor model fit the data well. A combined model with PGD items loading on one factor and PTSD items on seven factors (associations between PGD and PTSD subscales r ≥ .50 and ≤ .71), plus a higher-order factor (i.e., PTSD factors on a higher-order PTSD factor) (association between higher-order PTSD factor and PGD factor r = .82) exhibited a better fit than a model with all PGD and PTSD symptom loading on a single factor or two factors (i.e., one for PGD and one for PTSD). Conclusions: This is the first study examining the factor structure of DSM-5-TR PGD and DSM-5 PTSD in people confronted with a traumatic loss. The findings provide support that PGD constitutes a syndrome distinguishable from, yet related with, PTSD.",317

In this pilot study, we examined Life Events Checklist Questionnaire responses from participants who were clinically diagnosed with PTSD to identify if there was a difference in response to checklist questions based on gender. Materials and methods: Study participants (N = 39; n = 17 (43.6%) males; n = 22 (56.4%) females), with a PTSD diagnosis, were recruited in the US between January and June 2019 by PrecisionMed, California, USA. Study participants were matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. A CAPS-5 Life Events Checklist Questionnaire was applied at interview and symptom severity was calculated based on the sum of the participant responses. Results: In total, N = 33 questions from the CAPS-5 Life Events Checklist Questionnaire were addressed to each of the study participants. All but one question was significantly different between males and females; namely, the inability to recall certain aspects of the traumatic event (p < 0.05) (chi square χ2). However, as the patient cohort size was limited (N = 39), we applied a post hoc Bonferroni (α = 0.05/33 = 0.0015) to account for any potential bias in the results. Based on the post hoc analysis, we did not observe any differences in the participant response based on gender. Conclusions: Although the literature identifies gender as a significant risk for PTSD, in this participant cohort, we failed to observe any differences in the subject response to the CAPS-5 Life Events Checklist Questionnaire. The only finding that was significant was that females were 3-times more likely to experience sexual abuse than males. However, it is likely that males are more resistant to report sexual abuse, as was noted in the case report forms.",319

Traumatically injured patients ( N = 1,035) were assessed during hospital admission and at 3 (85%) and 12 months (73%). Quality of life prior to traumatic injury was measured with the World Health Organization Quality of Life–BREF during hospitalization and at each subsequent assessment. PTSD was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale at 3 and 12 months. After controlling for preinjury functioning, current pain, and comorbid depression, patients whose PTSD symptoms had resolved by 12 months were more likely to have poorer quality of life in psychological (OR = 3.51), physical (OR = 10.17), social (OR = 4.54), and environmental (OR = 8.83) domains than those who never developed PTSD. These data provide initial evidence that PTSD can result in lingering effects on functional capacity even after remission of symptoms.",320

The aim of the current study was to examine the validity of PTSD resulting from secondary traumatization by evaluating the longitudinal trajectories and clinical picture of PTSD following both direct exposure and indirect exposure to war trauma. One-hundred-and-fifty-five war veterans of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and their spouses filled out self-report questionnaires assessing PTSD, 30 (T1), 38 (T2), and 42 years (T3) after the war. Findings revealed that although PTSD was more prevalent and intense among veterans, the relative distribution of PTSD trajectories was similar among veterans and spouses. In both groups, the most prevalent was the resilient trajectory (43% and 73%, respectively), followed by the recovered trajectory (28% and 15%, respectively), the chronic trajectory (21% and 7%, respectively), and the delayed trajectory (8% and 6%, respectively). In addition, the composition of PTSD symptoms was similar among veterans and spouses at T1 and T2, but not at T3. These findings demonstrate that although PTSD is more prevalent and intense among individuals who were exposed to traumatic events directly as compared to those who were traumatized secondarily, the similarities in the clinical picture support the inclusion of secondary traumatization in PTSD Criterion A.",321

This work evaluates the 3-year outcome of offering early interventions to survivors with acute PTSD.Methods: Adults admitted consecutively to the hospital with acute DSM-IV PTSD were randomized, between June 2003 and October 2007, to 12 weeks of prolonged exposure (n = 63) or cognitive therapy (n = 40) or concealed SSRI (escitalopram; n = 23) versus placebo (n = 23). Eighty-two participants who declined treatment were followed as well. Treatment started 1 month after the traumatic event, and participants were reassessed 5 and 36 months later. Assessors were blinded to treatment allocation and acceptance. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) evaluated PTSD and PTSD symptoms. Self-reported symptoms, general functioning, and employment status were secondary outcomes. Participants lost to follow-up were missing completely at random.Results: Prolonged exposure and cognitive therapy significantly reduced PTSD and PTSD symptoms between 1 and 5 months (mean CAPS total scores at 1 month: prolonged exposure = 73.59 and cognitive therapy = 71.78 ; mean CAPS total scores at 5 months: prolonged exposure = 28.59 and cognitive therapy = 29.48 , P < .001), and their results remained stable. At 3 years, however, the study groups had similar levels of PTSD symptoms (mean CAPS total scores : prolonged exposure = 31.51 ; cognitive therapy = 32.08 ; SSRI = 34.31 ; placebo = 32.13 ; and no intervention = 30.59 ), similar prevalence of PTSD (28.6%-46.2%), and similar secondary outcomes.Conclusion: Early prolonged exposure and cognitive therapy accelerated the recovery from acute PTSD. Their effect remained stable, however, without reducing the 3-year prevalence of the disorder. The lingering prevalence of PTSD, despite efficient interventions, illustrates a nonremitting, treatment-refractory subset of survivors and outlines a major clinical and public health challenge.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00146900",322

That caused a necessity for a scale to measure the mentioned change. A scale named Dissociative Subtype of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (DSPS) was developed to measure this subtype and help the diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to adapt the Dissociative Subtype of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to Turkish and examine its reliability and validity. The Dissociative Subtype of PTSD (DSPS) was translated into Turkish. DSPS, Turkish forms of The Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale and Dissociative Experiences Scale were sent to participants via Google Forms and data from 279 people aged 18-45 were analyzed. Reliability tests and factor analysis were conducted. Factor analysis showed that scale has good model fit scores and items were loaded to the factors the same as the original study. Scales internal consistency was examined, and a good score was obtained (α=.84). Fit index values of confirmatory factor analysis were found as χ2/df = 2.51, GFI=.90, RMSEA=.07, RMR=.02. As a result of the high reliability scores and sufficient model fit scores, this scale is considered as a dependable measure to evaluate the dissociative subtype of PTSD.",323

However, selecting which measure to use can be difficult as there are currently no guidelines for selection. This research sought to evaluate self-report outcome measures for adults with PTSD and produce recommendations to guide clinicians.Method A systematic search was use qd to identify relevant articles and a comprehensive list of the existing measures of PTSD symptoms were extracted. A second search for validation papers for these measures was then conducted. Using these validation papers, measures were evaluated for their psychometric properties and utility for clinical practice via a purpose-built evaluation tool.Findings Twenty-two self-report outcome measures for PTSD were extracted from 256 randomised controlled trials. For these measures, 110 validation papers were located. For nonspecific trauma exposure populations, the PCL-5 and SPRINT were found to be the most psychometrically valid measures, with the highest scoring clinical utility. The measures for 12 specific trauma exposure populations were examined and discussed.Conclusion This paper has direct clinical relevance for working with individuals with PTSD and provides researchers and clinicians with justification for outcome measure selection.KEY POINTSWhat is already known about this topic: It is recommended that clinicians use validated, user-friendly self-report measures to support their assessments of treatment outcomes over time for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Clinicians may struggle to select which measure to use in their practice when faced with a plethora of choice regarding outcome measures for PTSD, especially given the impact of the DSM-5 update.The differences between measures which are utilised frequently (i.e. ‘common’ measures) and measures with good psychometric properties (i.e. validated measures) and those with good clinical utility (i.e. usability) can be difficult to understandWhat this topic adds: This paper used systematic review methodology was used to identify & evaluate a comprehensive list of self-report outcome measures for PTSD since the DSM-5 update in 2013 and the populations that they should be used with.For non-specific trauma exposure populations, the PCL-5 and SPRINT were found to be the most psychometrically valid measures, with the highest scoring clinical utility.The most psychometrically valid measures, with the highest scoring clinical utility for twelve specific trauma exposure populations are also presented.",324

Understanding how best to assess acute stress may inform early interventions seeking to prevent long-term morbidity/mortality following stroke. A mixed methods approach examined early post-stroke acute stress symptoms using the post-traumatic stress disorder checklist-5 (PCL-5) and the acute stress disorder scale (ASDS).A focus group of stroke survivors and/or their caregivers ( N=8) evaluated PCL-5/ASDS feasibility, and 20 patients hospitalized for acute stroke were interviewed 2-10 days post-stroke onset, using either the PCL-5 or the ASDS.Acute stress symptoms were present and measurable during acute stroke recovery. Assessment of acute stress in hospitalized patients with stroke is feasible; a briefer modified ASDS has advantages over the PCL-5.The ASDS is a viable and useful measure for assessing psychological distress during the acute post-stroke aftermath. Findings suggest that acute stress symptoms are present among patients with stroke, warranting greater attention to psychological responses in the early post-stroke period. Given that acute stress has serious potential long-term health consequences, additional research on stroke-related acute stress may prove useful for understanding post-stroke morbidity/mortality.",327

Left untreated, PTS is associated with poor outcomes and significant impairments in quality of life (HRQoL). Recent studies find 20-30% of IBD patients report significant PTS symptoms due to IBD experiences. The majority of participants in these studies are white, non-Hispanic making results difficult to generalize to other populations. As such, we aim to characterize IBD related PTS in under-represented minority (URM) patients. METHODS Adult patients 18+ who identify as a URM (Latino/a, African American, Asian, Middle Eastern, Native American or Native Pacific Islander) recruited via social media and researchmatch.org website completed an anonymous online survey: demographics, disease information, Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) or simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI) with &amp;gt;4 = active IBD, NIH-PROMIS QoL module (fatigue, sleep disturbance, social isolation, pain interreference), and PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL5) with &amp;gt;30 = suggested IBD-PTS, with subscale scores. Independent samples t-Test, Pearson’s correlation, and hierarchical linear regression statistics were used. RESULTS 67 participants: 46% UC, 79% female, 73% South/Southeast Asian, 6% Hispanic, Age (Mean±SD) = 35.42±9.79 years. 55% had active IBD (HBI/SCCAI &amp;gt; 4; 5.57±4.51). 43% scored &amp;gt;30 on PCL5. Specifically, 55.2% reported re-experiencing trauma, 59.7% avoiding trauma triggers, 62.7% mood changes/irritability, and 67.2% autonomic hyperarousal. Patients with active IBD reported higher IBD-PTS (p=.001) as well as more fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain interference, and social isolation (all p&amp;lt;.001); no differences by IBD diagnosis, gender, or age. When controlling for HBI/SCCAI score, IBD-PTS severity was a significant predictor, but smaller than disease severity, of fatigue (β=.223, p=.025) and pain interference (β=.254, p=.006), and a larger predictor of sleep disturbance (β=.424, p&amp;lt;.001) and social isolation (β= -.417, p&amp;lt;.001). Only the PTS symptoms of hyperarousal and mood contributed to these relationships. CONCLUSION 43% of URM met criteria for PTS, and scored above 50% in each symptom category of the PCL-5, suggesting URM patients are at even higher risk for IBD-related PTS. Despite disease severity, IBD-PTS severity predicted fatigue, pain interference, sleep disturbance, and social isolation domains of HRQoL; mood changes or hyperarousal presence appear to be the most important symptoms to address. IBD-PTS could have a greater influence on HRQoL than disease activity and should be assessed in patients with both active and inactive disease. More research is necessary to evaluate this relationship and the prevalence of IBD-PTS in URM.",329

Objective: The present study examines symptom profiles of PTSD and CG among bereaved Sichuan earthquake survivors 1 year after the disaster. Method: Self-report measures of demographic, disaster, and loss-related characteristics and symptoms of PTSD and CG were administered among 803 survivors (63% women; mean age = 46.7 years). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of people with different PTSD and CG symptom profiles. Results: The LCA demonstrated that a five-class solution yielded the best fit, consisting of a CG class with low PTSD and high CG (N = 208), a combined class with high PTSD and high CG (N = 205), a class with low PTSD and partial CG (N = 145), a class with partial PTSD and CG (N = 136), and a resilient class with low PTSD and CG (N = 108). Being a woman (vs man), losing a child or spouse (vs other), being injured (vs non-injured), and/or having a missing family member (vs non-missing) predicted membership of the CG class compared to other classes. Conclusions: CG appears to be a unique consequence of disasters involving many casualties. Disaster survivors should be screened for CG and provided with appropriate psychological treatment.Antecedentes: Los estudios en la salud mental luego de desastres se ha centrado principalmente en el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT), pero el duelo discapacitante y permanente (por ejemplo, duelo complicado, DC) también pareciera ser importante.Objetivo: El presente estudio examina los perfiles de síntomas de TEPT y DC entre los sobrevivientes del terremoto de Sichuan que perdieron a un ser querido, un año después del desastre.Método: A los 803 sobrevivientes (63% mujeres, edad media = 46,7 años), se les administraron medidas de auto-reporte sobre las características demográficas, del desastre, y relacionadas a la pérdida como también síntomas de TEPT y DC. El análisis de clases latentes (LCA en sus siglas en inglés) fue llevado a cabo para identificar subgrupos de personas con diferentes perfiles de TEPT y DC.Resultados: El LCA demostró que una solución de cinco clases presentó el mejor ajuste, consistiendo de una clase de DC con bajo TEPT y alto DC (N = 208), una clase combinada de alto TEPT y alto DC (N = 205), una clase de bajo TEPT y DC parcial (N = 145), una clase con TEPT y DC parciales (N = 136), y una clase resiliente con bajo TEPT y DC (N = 108). Ser mujer (vs. hombre), perder un hijo/a o cónyuge (vs. otro), estar lesionado/a (vs. no lesionado/a), y/o tener a un familiar perdido (vs. no perdido) predijeron la pertenencia a la clase del DC comparado a las otras clases.Conclusiones: El DC surge como una consecuencia única de los desastres involucrando a muchas víctimas. Los sobrevivientes de desastres deberían ser pesquisados por DC y tener acceso a tratamiento psicológico adecuado.背景：有关灾难的研究通常都关注创伤后应激障碍（PTSD），然而持续而强烈的哀伤（即，复杂哀伤，CG）也同样值得关注。目的：本研究探索四川地震一年以后，失去亲人的灾民们的PTSD 和CG症状情况。方法：共有803名丧亲的灾民（63%是女性，平均年龄47岁）完成了自我报告的问卷，内容包括人口学变量，与灾难和丧失有关的情况，以及测量PTSD与CG的问卷。用潜分类分析（LCA）来检测被试的PTSD与CG 症状分组情况。结果：分析结果表明被试的最佳分类是5组，包括CG组：低PTSD和高CG （N = 208），混合组：高PTSD及高CG （N = 205），一组低PTSD和部分CG（N =145），一组部分PTSD和CG (N = 136)，以及复原组：低PTSD低CG（N = 108）。女性（相比男性），失去孩子或配偶（相比失去其他人），有家庭成员失踪（相比无失踪），有家庭成员失踪（相比无失踪）能预测CG组（相对于其他组而言）。结论：在有人员伤亡的灾难中，CG是单独呈现的一组症状。灾难幸存者的CG情况应该被筛查并给予相应的支持。.",330

Further, examining predictors of PTSD pathology provides a better conceptualization of the temporal course of PTSD in trauma victims.The present study examined PTSD symptom severity in individuals presenting to the emergency department (ED) following a traumatic event. Participants (N = 147) were assessed at four timepoints: 2-weeks, 3-months, between 6 and 9 months, and 12-months after ED admission.

It will also investigate the association between changes in PTSD symptoms, intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and emotion regulation.Patients with PTSD will be recruited via the research arm of a not-for-profit clinical and research unit in Australia and randomised to a treatment group or waitlist control group. The minimum sample size for each group (alpha 0.05, power 0.80 for a g of 0.47) was identified as 72, but 10 % more will be recruited to hedge against expected attrition. PTSD diagnosis will be determined using the PTSD module from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview version 5.0.0. The PTSD Checklist - Civilian version (PCL-C) will be used to measure PTSD symptoms (the primary outcome measure), with the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale 12-item version (IUS-12) and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) used to measure intolerance of uncertainty and emotion regulation, respectively. The PCL-C will be administered to the treatment group before each lesson of the PTSD program and at 3-month follow-up. The IUS-12 and ERQ will be administered before lessons 1 and 4, at post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. The waitlist control group will complete these measures at week 1, week 5 and week 11 of the waitlist period. PTSD program efficacy will be determined using intent-to-treat mixed models. Maintenance of gains will be assessed at 3-month follow-up. Mediation analyses using PROCESS will be used to examine the association between change in PTSD symptoms over treatment and change in each of IU and emotion regulation ability in separate analyses.The current RCT seeks to replicate previous efficacy findings of iCBT for PTSD in a formally assessed PTSD sample from the general population.

This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to estimate the point prevalence of current PTSD-DS, and the extent to which method of assessment, demographic and trauma variables moderate this estimate, across different methods of prevalence estimation. Studies included were identified by searching MEDLINE (EBSCO), PsycInfo, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete and PTSDpubs, yielding 49 studies that met the inclusion criteria (N = 8214 participants). A random-effects meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of PTSD-DS as 38.1% (95% CI 31.5-45.0%) across all samples, 45.5% (95% CI 37.7-53.4%) across all diagnosis-based and clinical cut-off samples, 22.8% (95% CI 14.8-32.0%) across all latent class analysis (LCA) and latent profile analysis (LPA) samples and 48.1% (95% CI 35.0-61.3%) across samples which strictly used the DSM-5 PTSD criteria; all as a proportion of those already with a diagnosis of PTSD. All results were characterised by high levels of heterogeneity, limiting generalisability. Moderator analyses mostly failed to identify sources of heterogeneity. PTSD-DS was more prevalent in children compared to adults, and in diagnosis-based and clinical cut-off samples compared to LCA and LPA samples. Risk of bias was not significantly related to prevalence estimates. The implications of these results are discussed further.",333

We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was -24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and -13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation. PMID: 33972795",334

To examine these constructs in a student veteran sample (n = 297), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on six different models of PTSD, including a one-factor model, based on the 20 symptoms found in the DSM-5; PTSD was assessed using the PCL-5. Global fit statistics suggest that fit across all models, including the 1-factor model, were good [RMSEAs(0.054−0.056); CFIs(0.928−0.940); SRMRs(0.043−0.045)], and the AIC was lowest for the seven-factor hybrid model. Statistical tests and fit guidelines for nested models suggest there is no quantitative advantage of a five, six, or seven-factor model over the existing DSM-5 four-factor model. Given the high percentage of student veterans that screened positive for a probable PTSD diagnosis (53 %) in this study compared to non-student veterans (11–20 %) and the general student population (11–15 %) found in other studies, further research is needed to assess the clinical utility of these symptoms and model structures.",335

Valid and reliable measurement tools for assessing PTSD are essential and can aid screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment planning and outcome monitoring.This article outlines the range of instruments available for these aspects of measurement, including assessment of PTSD in very young children, with a focus on those scales with good clinical utility and sound psychometric properties.This is a particularly challenging time for clinicians working with children and young people with PTSD: all instruments will need to be revised and updated in order to better reflect the recent revisions to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD with the publication of the DSM-5 and no doubt the anticipated ICD-11. Despite this, measurement tools can still play a vital role in assessing PTSD in children and young people.",336

Predictors of development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with cancer,"Abstract Background Experiencing cancer is a highly stressful (traumatic) life-event which can lead to development of PTSD. PTSD can evolve after trauma in predisposed individuals, after being triggered by risk factors. The aim of this paper is to analyze the level of PTSD in patients with cancer in the context of other potential risk factors. Methods Three path models were analyzed in a sample of patients with cancer (N = 216). The models were focused on development of PTSD (PCL-5) in the context of psychological distress (SCL-90), personality traits (EPQ-R), perceived cognitive deficit (FACT-Cog), social support (BSSS), stressful life events, and selected socio-demographic, anamnestic, and medical variables. Mediation and moderation effects were also examined in the tested models. Results Two models explained 63% of the variation in PTSD, while one model explained 60% of the PTSD variation as well as 23% of the variation in perceived cognitive deficits. All 3 models revealed that neuroticism and psychological distress had a statistically significant positive influence on the level of PTSD. In all 3 models, it was found that neuroticism influenced PTSD directly and also indirectly by means of a higher level of psychological distress. Specifically, it was found that this relation depends on the time passed since the patients were diagnosed with cancer and also on the history of mental disorders. In patients with history of mental disorders and in the patients with a lower level of social support, a statistically significant positive influence of stressful life events on PTSD was found. Conclusion The Results draw attention to the possible mechanisms of the PTSD development under different combinations of individual risk factors. These findings offer not only new suggestions for the future research but provide also valuable implications for clinical practice.",337

Approximately half of the sample met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. PAI profiles were compared between the PTSD and non-PTSD groups. The PTSD group had clinically significant scores (≥ 70 T) on the PAI for 5 clinical scales (anxiety, anxiety-related disorders, depression, paranoia, and schizophrenia) and 10 clinical subscales consistent with the typical symptom picture for PTSD. Effect size correlations ( r) between scales and diagnosis group membership were large ( r ≥ .5) for several scales that reflect PTSD symptoms and for the PTSD LOGIT function. In a receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, the PTSD LOGIT function and the Traumatic Stress Subscale both demonstrated good diagnostic utility (areas under the curve &gt; .80).",338

The present study aims to expand on these findings by focusing on memory processes and exploring the influence that personality variables may have on the mediational role of PTSD symptoms. Methods In a sample of 196 U.S. military service members and veterans, we administered the PTSD checklist (PCL), Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), Memory Complaints Inventory (MCI), and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Results Overall MCI score (reflecting subjective memory complaints) was associated with both RBANS immediate (β= −0.15, SE = 0.06, p = 0.01) and delayed memory performance (β= −0.13, SE = 0.06, p = 0.02), but PTSD severity mediated both of these relationships (95% CI -0.14, −0.01; 95% CI -0.14, −0.02, respectively). Trait depression moderated the mediation path between subjective memory complaints and PTSD severity (β= −0.02, SE = 0.004, p &amp;lt; .001), but not the path between PTSD and either immediate or delayed memory performance (all p &amp;gt; .05). Conclusion Results suggest that targeting PTSD and depressive symptoms may be a promising treatment for those with subjective memory complaints.",339
https://openalex.org/W3090243294,,Determining the Diagnostic Accuracy of and Interpretation Guidelines for the Complex Trauma Inventory [CTI],"The work group in charge of editing the trauma disorders in the upcoming edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) made several changes to the trauma criteria. Specifically, they simplified the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and added a new trauma disorder called complex PTSD (CPTSD). To assess the new and newly defined trauma disorders, Litvin, Kaminski and Riggs developed a self-report trauma measure called the Complex Trauma Inventory (CTI). Although the reliability and validity of the CTI has been supported, no empirically-derived cutoff scores exist. We determined the optimal CTI cutoff scores using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses in a diverse sample of 82 participants who experienced trauma and were recruited from an inpatient trauma unit, student veteran organizations, and university classrooms. We used the Clinician-Administered Interview for Trauma Disorders (CAIT) to diagnose the presence of an ICD-11 trauma disorder, and we correlated the results of the CAIT with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the DSM-5 to establish the convergent validity of the CAIT, r = .945, p < .001. For the ROC analyses, the CTI was used as the index test and the CAIT was used as the criterion test. The area under the curve (AUC) analyses indicated good to excellent effect sizes, AUC = .879 to .904. We identified two sets of cutoff scores for the CTI: the first set prioritized the sensitivity of the CTI scores and ranged from .884 to .962; the second set prioritized the specificity of the CTI scores and the false-positive scores (1-specificity) ranged from .054 to .143. Our study enhanced the utility of the CTI and addressed another need in the trauma field by developing a structured clinical interview (CAIT) that can be used to diagnose the ICD-11 trauma disorders.",340
https://openalex.org/W3200940247,10.17918/etd-7271,Social Problem-Solving and Posttraumatic Growth among United States Military Veterans,"The present study hypothesized that social problem-solving (SPS), or the process by which a person understands, devises, and implements strategies to resolve problems they encounter in life, is a factor that contributes to the experience of PTG in United States Military Veterans. This research study was developed to examine the relative contributions of components in the SPS model to levels of PTG in Veterans, and explore additional relationships that may provide insight to the nature of SPS and PTG in relation to stressful or traumatic events. Participants were 154 individuals who indicated that they were Veterans of the United States Military and completed a demographics questionnaire and three standardized self-report instruments. Recruitment was conducted through a mixed-methods approach, consisting of individuals recruited in-person through a local Veterans organization in Philadelphia, PA, and online through the use of snowball sampling and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The three study instruments completed by participants were the Social Problem-Solving Inventory – Revised: Short Form (SPSI-R:SF) to measure social problem-solving orientations and styles, the Posttraumatic Checklist for the DSM-V (PCL-5) to measure posttraumatic stress symptoms, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory – Revised (PTGI) to measure perceived growth after a stressful or traumatic event. The main research questions of this study consisted of hierarchical multiple linear regression models that investigated the relative contributions of SPS model components to PTG and symptoms of PTSD. Reported tobacco use was found to be a significant predictor of PTG in the sample, while combat experience, deployment experience, and alcohol use were significant predictors. These variables were included as covariates in the main regression analyses to control for their impact on the outcomes of interest. The effective SPS factors of positive problem orientation (PPO) and rational/planful problem-solving style (RPS) were significant predictors of PTG, while the ineffective SPS factor of negative problem orientation (NPO) was a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms. The secondary aim of this study was to explore the form of the relationship between PTG and PTSD, and explore the contributions of trauma-related characteristics to variability in PTG. PTG was found to have a curvilinear association with PTSD symptoms, and was unrelated to both the perceived stressfulness and perceived impact of the event at the time it occurred. The findings of this study establish an important association between SPS and PTG, which reveals that increases in effective SPS factors corresponds to increases in PTG. Further, this study replicates previous research findings that NPO to be an important predictor of PTSD symptoms, and PTG to be highest in individuals with moderate levels of PTSD symptoms. Our results suggest that SPS plays a role in both symptoms of PTSD and levels of PTG, indicating that Problem-Solving Therapy (PST), an evidence-based psychosocial intervention…",341

This retrospective analysis evaluated the course of treatment among 884 active duty Army service members in routine outpatient care.Patients were included in the analysis based on a screening score of 50 or higher on the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C) at intake. Patients subsequently completed the PCL-C at periodic intervals during behavioral health encounters. A multilevel model predicting PCL-C score was constructed with the number of encounters and days between encounters as predictor variables, controlling for intake PCL-C scores.A higher number of total encounters during the entire study period predicted lower scores on the PCL-C. Quadratic effects showed that encounter frequency of less than 3 weeks and treatment during the first 8 encounters was associated with lower symptoms. A curvilinear effect showed that long breaks in care are associated with greater PTSD symptoms, but also that very-frequent care (e.g., twice weekly) would be associated with greater symptoms.These results suggest the need to carefully monitor the frequency and overall dose of behavioral health encounters for PTSD among active duty military patients, suggesting that the greatest treatment gains occur early in treatment and that there is a need for idiographic treatment planning that addresses both the needs of the patient and the mission needs of the military command.

https://openalex.org/W2380817746,10.1136/jim-2016-000120.68,Factors Associated with Treatment Seeking in Veterans with Late-Onset Ptsd,"Background and Significance Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic anxiety disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 6.8% in the general population and up to 30% among Vietnam War veterans. While presentation of PTSD is typically acute, delayed onset of PTSD (i.e., 6 months post trauma) is considered to be relatively rare. There is anecdotal evidence supporting reactivation of trauma memories and symptoms of PTSD among aging veterans who previously had no symptoms or treatment for PTSD. Clinically this type of presentation appears to be different from those presenting with symptoms earlier in life. It is unclear what might precipitate or reactivate these symptoms many years following trauma exposure. The Veterans Health Administration has a growing population of aging veterans exposed to combat during their military service. Current treatment guidelines provide limited guidance towards the management of late-onset PTSD. The prevalence of PTSD among OEF/OIF veterans is very high and as this cohort ages, we need to be better equipped to manage clinical changes seen across the lifespan. Understanding the clinical phenomenology, risk factors and potential biomarkers of this condition could pave the way for better screening methods and treatment interventions for clinicians. Objective To identify the characteristics and risk factors among late-life post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment seekers. Methods The study is a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with PTSD after the age of 55 and a comparison group of veterans diagnosed with PTSD prior to the age of 55 in the VA Nebraska–Western Iowa Health Care System. Results Primary variables for analysis included demographic factors, military history, age at treatment seeking, PTSD Checklist (PCL) scores, PTSD treatment, recent stressors/reasons for seeking treatment (e.g., recent life changes, another trauma or reminder), and comorbid medical conditions. Conclusions A number of explanations have been proposed for the development of late-onset PTSD, including chronic inflammation and cumulative stress. We are conducting a separate study to determine whether plasma concentration of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) might help in predicting late-onset PTSD. Further studies are needed to evaluate the contributions of other factors (e.g., physical or cognitive decline, sleep disturbances, other traumas) to late-onset PTSD.",343

Results of previous studies support the validity of this concept. However, due to limitations of existing studies (e.g. homogeneity of the samples), the present study aimed to test the construct validity and factor structure of cPTSD and its distinction from PTSD using a heterogeneous trauma-exposed sample. Method: Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to explore the factor structure of the proposed ICD-11 cPTSD diagnosis in a sample of 341 trauma-exposed adults (n = 191 female, M = 37.42 years, SD = 12.04). In a next step, latent profile analyses (LPAs) were employed to evaluate predominant symptom profiles of cPTSD symptoms. Results: The results of the CFA showed that a six-factor structure (i.e. symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal and symptoms of affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal problems) fits the data best. According to LPA, a four-class solution optimally characterizes the data. Class 1 represents moderate PTSD and low symptoms in the specific cPTSD clusters (PTSD group, 30.4%). Class 2 showed low symptom severity in all six clusters (low symptoms group, 24.1%). Classes 3 and 4 both exhibited cPTSD symptoms but differed with respect to the symptom severity (Class 3: cPTSD, 34.9% and Class 4: severe cPTSD, 10.6%). Conclusions: The findings replicate previous studies supporting the proposed factor structure of cPTSD in ICD-11. Additionally, the results support the validity and usefulness of conceptualizing PTSD and cPTSD as discrete mental disorders.Antecedentes: Los criterios propuestos por la CIE-11 para los trastornos relacionados con trauma, define el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) y el trastorno de estrés postraumático complejo (TEPTc) como dos trastornos separados. Los resultados de estudios previos apoyan la validez de este concepto. Sin embargo, debido a las limitaciones de los estudios existentes (ej. Homogeneidad de las muestras), el presente estudio tuvo como objetivo probar la validez de constructo y la estructura factorial del TEPTc y su distinción del TEPT utilizando una muestra heterogénea expuesta a trauma. Metodo: Se realizaron análisis de factores confirmatorios (AFCs) para explorar la estructura de los factores del diagnóstico propuesto de TEPTc por la CIE-11 en una muestra de 341 adultos expuestos al trauma (n = 191 mujeres, M = 37.42 años, SD = 12.04). En un siguiente paso, se emplearon análisis de perfil latente (APL) para evaluar los perfiles de síntomas predominantes de los síntomas de TEPTc. Resultados: Los resultados de la AFC mostraron que una estructura de seis factores (es decir, síntomas de intrusión, evitación, hiperalerta y síntomas de desregulación afectiva, autoconcepto negativo y problemas interpersonales) se ajusta mejor a los datos. Según los APL, una solución de cuatro clases caracteriza de manera óptima los datos. La clase 1 representa un trastorno de estrés postraumático moderado y síntomas bajos en los grupos de específicos de TEPTc (grupo de trastorno de estrés postraumático, 30.4%). La clase 2 mostró una baja gravedad de los síntomas en los seis conglomerados (grupo de síntomas bajos, 24.1%). Las clases 3 y 4 mostraron síntomas de TEPTc, pero difirieron con respecto a la gravedad de los síntomas (clase 3: TEPTc, 34.9% y clase 4: TEPTc grave, 10.6%). Conclusiones: Los hallazgos replican estudios previos que respaldan la estructura de factores propuesta del TEPTc en la CIE-11. Además, los resultados respaldan la validez y la utilidad de conceptualizar el TEPT y el TEPTc como trastornos mentales distintos.背景：ICD-11（草案）的创伤相关疾病标准中，将创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）和复杂创伤后应激障碍（cPTSD）定义为不同的疾病。前人研究结果支持这一提议。然而，由于现有研究具有局限性（例如样本的同质性），本研究旨在测试cPTSD的结构效度和因子结构及其在异质创伤暴露样本中与PTSD的区别。 方法：在341名有创伤经历的成年人样本中（n = 191名女性，M = 37.42岁，SD = 12.04）使用验证性因子分析（CFAs）考察ICD-11 （草案）中cPTSD诊断的因子结构。之后，使用潜剖面分析（LPAs）来评估cPTSD症状的主要症状剖面。 结果：CFA的结果显示六因素结构（即：闯入，回避，高唤起和情感失调症状，消极的自我概念和人际关系问题）最拟合数据。根据LPA，四分类方案可以最佳概括数据。 1类代表中度PTSD和特定cPTSD症状簇中的低症状（PTSD组，30.4％）。第2类显示所有六症状簇严重程度较低（低症状组，24.1％）。第3类和第4类均表现出cPTSD症状，但在症状严重程度方面存在差异（第3类：cPTSD，34.9％；和第4类：严重cPTSD，10.6％）。 结论：该研究结果重复了先前支持ICD-11中cPTSD因子结构的研究。此外，该结果支持PTSD和cPTSD是有区别的精神障碍概念，这种区分具有有效性和有用性。.",345

This study aimed to characterize threats to precise PTSD assessment that arose during the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (CAPS-5). Our sample (N = 44) included trans women (38%), trans men (25%), nonbinary people (23%), and other TGD identities (14%). Participants were mostly White (75%), non-Latinx (82%), educated (91% at least some college), with a mean age of 37 years (SD = 15.5). Demographic and CAPS-5 scoring data as well as content analysis of audio-recorded CAPS-5 interviews are reported. All participants reported trauma exposure, and nearly half met PTSD diagnostic criteria (49%). Interpersonal assault was a common trauma type linked to posttraumatic symptoms (77%); 41% were sexual assaults; and 41% were discrimination-based (e.g., linked to gender identity) physical or sexual assaults. Qualitative findings suggest how and when discrimination-related experiences may threaten PTSD assessment accuracy, leading to overpathologizing or underdetection of symptoms, for example, (a) initial selection of a noncriterion A discrimination event as ""worst event,"" (b) linking symptoms to internalized transphobia (rather than trauma), and (c) linking victimization to gender identity/expression. Threats to PTSD assessment were more common when symptoms were linked to discrimination-based traumatic events, suggesting the importance of understanding contextual factors of index events. We offer a framework for understanding unique challenges to the assessment of PTSD among TGD people and provide recommendations for improving assessment.

The current study aimed to verify the robustness of the psychometric properties of the German CAPS-5 via validating it within a routine clinical context.Methods: Overall, 288 participants were recruited. A multi-trait/multi-method design was used to analyze the validity of the German CAPS-5. Furthermore, the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and diagnostic accuracy of the German CAPS-5 were investigated. Finally, a cut-off score for the diagnosis of PTSD based on the German CAPS-5 was calculated using ROC analyses.Results: The study showed good to excellent internal consistency, test-retest reliability, interrater reliability, construct validity, and diagnostic accuracy of the German CAPS-5. Finally, the study revealed a cut-off score of ≥ 40.Discussion: The German CAPS-5 was found to be a structured diagnostic interview with good to excellent psychometric properties.

A total of 51 chronic nonmalignant pain patients exposed to a traumatic event were consecutively recruited from a multidisciplinary pain center. All participants answered a baseline questionnaire followed by the PTSD-8 and the diagnostic interview for PTSD. Finally, the latent structure of PTSD-8 was tested in a large cohort of 419 patients with chronic nonmalignant pain using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In total, 33.3% had a diagnosis of PTSD. A good overall accuracy was found validating the PTSD-8 against the diagnostic interview. Convergent validity was indicated as the PTSD-8 correlated strongly with scores of depression and anxiety. The results of the CFA for the PTSD-8 three-factor structure provided excellent fit for the eight post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Overall, the results showed that the PTSD-8 is a valid short screening tool to assess possible post-traumatic stress disorder among patients with chronic pain. In addition, the PTSD-8 scale comprises all of the upcoming ICD-11 post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms within its eight items. Thus, the PTSD-8 is likely also to measure the proposed ICD-11 post-traumatic stress disorder.",349

Previous literature suggests that there may be particular challenges in assessing PTSD in children and adolescents. There is evidence that once PTSD has been identified, a trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) approach is effective at treating PTSD in young people. Where PTSD in adolescents presents in response to multiple traumas it may be necessary to make some modifications to treatment protocols. This might include offering more sessions, extending the stabilization period, addressing common trauma themes, and tackling additional issues that may arise beyond a simple PTSD presentation. This single-case quasi-experimental design ( n = 1 ) details the assessment (phase A) and treatment with individualized TF-CBT (phase B) of previously undiagnosed PTSD in response to multiple events in an adolescent girl who had been seen by several mental health professionals previously. The paper is also a clinical case report, paying particular attention to how PTSD was assessed and what other factors, for example emotion regulation, self-esteem and relationships, were found to be important. Trauma, anxiety and depression were measured with the Child PTSD Symptom Scale and the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale. Scores reduced from clinically significant to non-clinical levels by the end of treatment, with these gains being maintained at 3-month follow-up. Suggestions are made around assessing and treating trauma responses in young people, especially where PTSD exists in response to multiple traumas.",350

Current PTSD assessment practices are not fully sensitive to the complex symptomatic picture observed among individuals exposed to ongoing stress and are therefore limited for use in these situations. The current survey aimed to portray the posttraumatic characteristics most salient to ongoing exposure to political conflict. A questionnaire enquiring about various aspects of the posttraumatic consequences of ongoing exposure to political conflict as compared with those associated with a single exposure to trauma was disseminated to therapists throughout the country. Participants were asked to rank 75 posttraumatic characteristics for their relevance to each trauma type (about the symptom frequency and severity) and item mean scores were compared. The sample consisted of 66 responses valid for analysis. Our findings pinpoint some of the posttraumatic characteristics most salient to ongoing exposure to political conflict and highlight the complexity of the posttraumatic picture observed in these situations. Incorporating these in post trauma assessment tools will allow for the development of standardized, reliable definitions, which in turn will allow for more accurate diagnosis and more effective treatment protocols.",351

We developed the Dissociative Subtype of PTSD Interview (DSP-I). This clinician-administered instrument assesses the presence and severity of PTSD-DS (i.e., symptoms of depersonalization or derealization) and contains a supplementary checklist that enables assessment and differentiation of other trauma-related dissociative symptoms (i.e., blanking out, emotional numbing, alterations in sensory perception, amnesia, and identity confusion). The psychometric properties were tested in 131 treatment-seeking individuals with PTSD and histories of multiple trauma, 17.6 % of whom met criteria for PTSD-DS in accordance with the DSP-I. The checklist was tested in 275 treatment-seeking individuals. Results showed the DSP-I to have high internal consistency, good convergent validity with PTSD-DS items of the CAPS-5, and good divergent validity with scales of somatization, anxiety and depression. The depersonalization and derealization scales were highly associated. Moreover, the DSP-I accounted for an additional variance in PTSD severity scores of 8% over and above the CAPS-5 and number of traumatic experiences. The dissociative experiences of the checklist were more strongly associated with scales of overall distress, somatization, depression, and anxiety than scales of depersonalization and derealization. In conclusion, the DSP-I appears to be a clinically relevant and psychometrically sound instrument that is valuable for use in clinical and research settings.",352

Severe PPH can be experienced as a traumatic event. PTSD leads to negative mental health effects. Knowing risk factors for PTSD during childbirth offers opportunities for early interventions, which may prevent the development of PTSD.In this prospective study, we compared two groups of participants; women with ≥2000 mL of blood loss (severe PPH, patients) and women with ≤500 mL of blood loss (controls). Participants were screened for PTSD using the PCL-5 four to six weeks after delivery. Positive screening was followed by the CAPS-5 to diagnose PTSD.We included 187 PPH patients and 121 controls. Median PCL-5 scores were higher for PPH patients (5.0) than controls (4.0, p = 0.005). Thirteen PPH patients (7.0%) and two controls (1.7%) scored ≥32 on the PCL-5, indicative of probable PTSD (OR 4.45, 95% CI 0.99-20.06, p = 0.035). Significant more PPH patients than controls met criteria for a clinical diagnosis of PTSD on the CAPS-5 (n = 10, 5.6% vs n = 0, 0.0%; p = 0.007).There is a significant and clinically relevant increased risk for developing PTSD after severe PPH. Gynecologists and midwives are advised to screen for PTSD at postpartum follow-up visits to prevent long-term negative mental health effects.NL50273.100.14.",353

Currently, there is no psychosocial screening instrument that can be used in patients surviving a physical trauma or injury. Therefore, we recently developed a psychosocial screening instrument for adult physical trauma patients, the PSIT. The aim of this study was to finalize and psychometrically examine the PSIT. Methods All adult (≥ 18 years) trauma patients admitted to a Dutch level I trauma center from October 2016 through September 2017 without severe cognitive disorders ( n = 1448) received the PSIT, Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Abbreviated version (WHOQOL-Bref). After 2 weeks, a subgroup of responding participants received the PSIT a second time. The internal structure (principal components analysis, PCA; and confirmatory factor analysis, CFA), internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha, α), test-retest reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, ICC), construct validity (Spearman’s rho correlations), diagnostic accuracy (Area Under the Curve, AUC), and potential cut-off values (sensitivity and specificity) were examined. Results A total of 364 (25.1%) patients participated, of whom 128 completed the PSIT again after 19.5 ± 6.8 days. Test-retest reliability was good (ICC = 0.86). Based on PCA, five items were removed because of cross-loadings ≥ 0.3. Three subscales were identified: (1) Negative affect (7 items; α = 0.91; AUC = 0.92); (2) Anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (4 items; α = 0.77; AUC = 0.88); and (3) Social and self-image (4 items; α = 0.79; AUC = 0.92). CFA supported this structure (comparative fit index = 0.96; root mean square error of approximation = 0.06; standardized rood mean square residual = 0.04). Four of the five a priori formulated hypotheses regarding construct validity were confirmed. The following cut-off values represent maximum sensitivity and specificity: 7 on subscale 1 (89.6% and 83.4%), 3 on subscale 2 (94.4% and 90.3%), and 4 on subscale 3 (85.7% and 90.7%). Conclusion The final PSIT has good psychometric properties in adult trauma patients.",354

Latent transition analysis was then used to examine individuals' probabilities of transitioning into each latent class at Time 2 based on their latent class membership at Time 1.A four-class model emerged as the best fitting model at both Time 1 and Time 2. Classes demonstrated overall severity and symptom cluster severity differences. Transition into a lower severity class was more common than transition into a higher severity class, though escalation was demonstrated by 6-20% of participants in each latent class.The substantial heterogeneity in sexual assault survivors' PTSD symptoms highlights the variety of ways that posttraumatic stress may be experienced years after a sexual assault. Future research should explore factors that affect long-term symptoms, including cumulative lifetime trauma and social support. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",355

The rationale was to determine whether (1) posttraumatic dissociation and/or minimization or (2) certain biases (more recent symptoms, more severe symptoms, practice effect, Hawthorne effect) might undermine symptom recall. Seventeen voluntary participants provided daily self-ratings for an average of 11.6 months. Nine male veterans had combat trauma; one also experienced sexual trauma. Four women had experienced sexual assault, and four women had other trauma. The monthly measure consisted of the self-rated Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL), and daily ratings employed the self-rated PTSD Life Chart that we devised. These data revealed that people with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) produced monthly ratings that reflected their day-to-day symptom experience over the previous month, despite the dissociation and minimization that often accompanies PTSD. Initial practice effect occurred in the first month, but other biases (recent symptoms, severe symptoms, Hawthorne effect) were not demonstrated.",356

Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) while the PTSD Checklist-civilian (PCL-C) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess symptoms of PTSD and generalized anxiety. Hierarchical logistic regression procedures were used to evaluate relations between TEQ and symptoms of psychiatric disorders. The majority of participants (87.8%) experienced at least one traumatic event (mean = 2.5 events). The trauma occurrence score was moderately correlated with symptoms of PTSD (PCL-C: rho = 0.38, P-value < 0.0001), depression (EPDS: rho = 0.31, P-value < 0.0001; PHQ-9: rho = 0.20, P-value < 0.0001), and GAD (GAD-7: rho = 0.29, P-value < 0.0001). Stronger correlations were observed between the trauma intensity score with symptoms of psychiatric disorders (PCL-C: rho = 0.49, P-value < 0.0001; EPDS: rho = 0.36, P-value < 0.0001; PHQ-9: rho = 0.31, P-value < 0.0001; GAD-7: rho = 0.39, P-value < 0.0001).

In accordance with this new classification, prior studies using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) empirically identified a subgroup of patients that were characterized by a high severity of dissociative symptoms. Despite the high prevalence of PTSD in patients with substance use disorders (SUD), however, no LCA studies on the dissociative subtype of PTSD exist in this population so far. Therefore, the current study aimed to identify subgroups of patients with different symptom and exposure profiles in patients with SUD and PTSD. It was assumed that one symptom and exposure profile could be identified that would be characterized by higher dissociative symptoms, higher additional psychopathology and a higher burden of childhood trauma, as compared to other subgroups. In N = 258 female patients with SUD and PTSD, clinical characteristics of dissociative symptoms, PTSD severity, borderline personality disorder (BPD), depression, childhood trauma and substance abuse were assessed. To identify symptom and exposure profiles, Latent Class Analysis was applied.A three-class solution indicated the best model fit to our data. One class was characterized by a high probability of dissociative symptoms (D-PTSD class), whereas the other two classes were characterized by lower probabilities of dissociative symptoms. The D-PTSD class encompassed 18.7% of the patients. In accordance with our hypothesis, the D-PTSD class showed higher probabilities of PTSD severity, borderline personality disorder symptoms, depressive symptoms, childhood emotional and sexual abuse, childhood emotional neglect, and drug abuse. Our results indicate that the dissociative subtype of PTSD could also be identified in a sample of female patients with SUD. Patients with SUD and PTSD characterized by the dissociative subtype showed more severe psychopathological symptoms than the remaining patients, indicating enhanced clinical needs for this vulnerable group.",358
https://openalex.org/W2587041839,,Impact of new traumatic or stressful life-events on preexisting PTSD in traumatized refugees : results of a longitudinal study: results of a longitudinal study,"Background: A significant proportion of trauma survivors experience an additional critical life event in the aftermath. These renewed experiences of traumatic and stressful life events may lead to an increase in trauma-related mental health symptoms.

Method: In a longitudinal study, the effects of renewed experiences of a trauma or stressful life event were examined. For this purpose, refugees seeking asylum in Germany were assessed for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS), Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), anxiety, and depression (Hopkins Symptom Checklist [HSCL-25]) before treatment start as well as after 6 and 12 months during treatment (N=46). Stressful life events and traumatic events were recorded monthly. If a new event happened, PDS and HSCL were additionally assessed directly afterwards. Mann–Whitney U-tests were performed to calculate the differences between the group that experienced an additional critical event (stressful vs. trauma) during treatment (n=23) and the group that did not (n=23), as well as differences within the critical event group between the stressful life event group (n=13) and the trauma group (n=10).

Results: Refugees improved significantly during the 12-month period of our study, but remained severely distressed. In a comparison of refugees with a new stressful life event or trauma, significant increases in PTS, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were found directly after the experience, compared to the group without a renewed event during the 12 months of treatment. With regard to the different critical life events (stressful vs. trauma), no significant differences were found regarding overall PTS, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Only avoidance symptoms increased significantly in the group experiencing a stressful life event.

Conclusion: Although all clinicians should be aware of possible PTS symptom reactivation, especially those working with refugees and asylum seekers, who often experience new critical life events, should understand symptom fluctuation and address it in treatment.",359

This is the second empirical evaluation of the intervention. Methods: This study used a randomized wait-list-controlled design ( n=30) to examine the efficacy of three sessions of RTM among male Veterans having high symptom scores on the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview (PSS-I) and the PTSD Checklist – military version (PCL-M) with current-month flashbacks and nightmares. Of the 55 volunteers, 30 met inclusion criteria and participated in the study, 15 each were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. After completing a six-week wait period, control subjects also received the intervention. Results: Data analyses suggest that RTM was superior to control. There were significant pre-post treatment improvements across measures of PTSD. Gains were maintained at 6 and 12-month follow-ups. At six months post, within group RTM effect sizes (Hedges' g) ranged from 2.79 to 5.33. Further, at six months post, 88% of those treated had lost the DSM diagnosis for PTSD: 15% had lost DSM diagnosis (CPL-M&lt;50 and DSM criteria not met) and 73% were in complete remission from all symptoms (PCL-M&lt;30). Therapist competence and adherence to treatment protocols were both strong. Patient satisfaction with the intervention was high.

As exposure to trauma triggers activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, examining atypical stress responses via HPA-axis hormones, namely cortisol, may help in the delineation of these disorders. Indeed, extant research demonstrates that, following stress, individuals with chronic PTSD exhibit hypocortisolism (e.g., lower cortisol response than controls), while those with chronic depression exhibit hypercortisolism (e.g., higher response than controls). Less is known about the role of cortisol and these seemingly disparate profiles immediately following traumatic injury as well as whether cortisol can be used as a predictor of future development of PTSD versus depression symptoms. In this study cortisol was measured blood from 172 traumatic injury survivors during hospitalization (on average 2.5 days post-injury). PTSD and depression severity were assessed from Clinician Assessed PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) six-eight months later using a two-factor dimensional approach that measures trauma-specific symptoms of PTSD versus dysphoria (akin to depression). Cluster analysis was used to group individuals based on post-injury cortisol, PTSD, and dysphoria. Results demonstrated that trauma survivors who only developed symptoms of dysphoria at six months (with minimal symptoms of PTSD) were differentiated by high post-injury cortisol compared to other groups. By contrast, individuals who developed symptoms of both PTSD and dysphoria were differentiated by low post-injury cortisol and most severe symptoms of PTSD. Findings provide support for the presence of subgroups of trauma survivors defined, in part, by post-trauma cortisol.",361

This study examined the relationship between history of being bullied and/or assaulted and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster. During 2015–2016, a modified life events checklist was administered to responders at Stony Brook WTC Health Program. WTC-related PTSD symptoms were assessed by PTSD checklist (PCL). Longitudinal mixed models examined associations between bullying, other forms of assault, and severity and chronicity of PTSD symptoms. Approximately, 13% of 920 responders had probable WTC-PTSD (PCL≥44). Being bullied in childhood was associated with increased odds of WTC-PTSD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 7.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.12–25.34), adjusted for demographics, other stressors, and WTC exposures. PTSD odds decreased over time among those not bullied (aOR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73–0.92), but not among victims. Experiencing physical, sexual, or verbal assaults during adulthood also had a significant association with WTC-PTSD (aOR 4.64; 95% CI: 1.98–10.92). Findings suggest being bullied in childhood and/or assaulted in adulthood can increase PTSD risk and progression after mass trauma.",362

Available information is limited by insufficient follow-up and lack of longitudinal studies. Baseline factors (e.g., sex; obesity) have been related to PTSD, but post-hospitalization factors have not been studied. Objective: This study aimed to analyse prevalence, baseline, post-discharge factors and possible clinical courses of PTSD after hospitalization for COVID-19. Method: 109 patients (94.7% of the original sample) completed a programme of three follow-up telephone assessments during the year following hospitalization. Data included clinical and sociodemographic factors as well as psychometric tools assessing PTSD, social support, and perception of threat to life (PTL). Mixture model analysis was performed to study the longitudinal course of PTSD symptoms. Chronic (>6 months) PTSD predictors were also analysed. Results: 1-year PTSD period prevalence was 23.9%, peaking at six months; 11% of the patients suffered chronic PTSD. Pre- and post-hospitalization factors influenced the onset and course of PTSD over time. These included working status, PTL, and lack of social support. Interestingly, obesity, pulmonary diseases and family cluster infection seem specifically related to PTSD following COVID-19. Inversely, clinical interventions, older age and male gender were protective. Conclusions: PTSD following COVID-19 hospitalization is common. The analysed demographic, social, clinical, and psychological factors predict PTSD symptomatology over time and can modify odds of a chronic course. Clinicians could better identify cases at risk of a chronic PTSD course. Finally, treatment as usual appeared related to a better outcome and should be proposed to patients with PTSD.",363

Objective To determine the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in the resident physician population of the University of British Columbia based on the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria. Method A link to an online questionnaire containing 27 questions, including residency training and year, as well as the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fifth edition (PCL-5) was e-mailed and completed by the resident physicians of the University of British Columbia. Results Forty-three residents completed the survey and 38 had complete data. Mean PCL-5 score was 10.3 for the 38 subjects. Differences between PCL-5 score and resident year yielded the following: postgraduate year (PGY)-1=8.6; PGY-2=16.5; PGY-3=3.6; PGY-4=4.0; PGY-5=7.7. With respect to the type of traumatic event and PCL-5 score, the following was observed: Death=5.3, Violence=13.8, Medical Error=8.0, Bullying=38.0, None=45.0. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed no statistically significant differences in total PCL-5 score for PGY or type of traumatic event. Regardless of post-graduate year or trauma experience, four subjects out of 38 (10.5%) had a total PCL-5 score of 33 or greater, while one subject (2.5%) had a score greater than 50. Conclusion The results from this study conclude that resident physicians do suffer from PTSD symptoms at a rate higher than the average American population. As PTSD symptoms can often be very distressing and potentially affect work ethic negatively, further studies are indicated to better understand these symptoms and hopefully lead to better care in treating PTSD symptoms in resident physicians.",364

Factor mixture modeling (FMM) was employed to establish the dimensional structure of CPTSD symptomology and the categorical distribution of these dimensions. It was then evaluated whether trauma history could differentiate between the distribution of trauma response profiles.A correlated 6-factor model with 5 latent classes was the best fitting model. Two classes were characterized by symptom profiles that were consistent with ICD-11 CPTSD and PTSD formulations. The remaining classes were characterized by nonspecific variation across dimensions. CPTSD class membership was predicted by traumas that were predominantly interpersonal in nature (serious neglect, physical assault, and sexual assault), whereas PTSD class membership was predicted by situational traumatic experiences (unarmed civilian in a conflict environment and a serious accident). A distinct dose-response effect was evident between cumulative traumatic exposure and CPTSD class membership.FMM class profiles distinguished between PTSD and CPTSD symptom formulations. Moreover, class membership was determined by specific trauma-exposure histories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",365

A person-centered approach to discern heterogeneous patterns of such co-occurring symptoms is recommended (Galatzer-Levy and Bryant, 2013). We assessed heterogeneity in PTSD and depression symptomatology; and subsequently assessed relations between class membership with psychopathology constructs (alcohol use, distress tolerance, dissociative experiences).The sample consisted of 268 university students who had experienced a PTE and susequently endorsed clinical levels of PTSD or depression severity. Latent profile analyses (LPA) was used to identify the best-fitting class solution accouring to recommended fit indices (Nylund et al., 2007a); and the effects of covariates was analyzed using a 3-step approach (Vermunt, 2010).Results of the LPA indicated an optimal 3-class solutions: high severity (Class 2), lower PTSD-higher depression (Class 1), and higher PTSD-lower depression (Class 3). Covariates of distress tolerance, and different kinds of dissociative experiences differentiated the latent classes.Use of self-report measure could lead to response biases; and the specific nature of the sample limits generalizability of results.We found evidence for a depressive subtype of PTSD differentiated from other classes in terms of lower distress tolerance and greater dissociative experiences. Thus, transdiagnostic treatment protocols may be most beneficial for these latent class members. Further, the distinctiveness of PTSD and depression at comparatively lower levels of PTSD severity was supported (mainly in terms of distress tolerance abilities); hence supporting the current classification system placement of these disorders.",366

We further administered the Acute Stress Disorder Scale and the Posttraumatic Symptom Scale-10 to assess symptoms of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Three percent of the patients had an acute stress disorder diagnosis 4 weeks after transfer to postacute rehabilitation. Posttraumatic stress disorder was found in 7% of the patients at 3-month follow-up and in 12% after 6 months, respectively. Eighteen percent of the patients showed a delayed onset of posttraumatic stress disorder. Sepsis turned out to be a significant predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at 3-month follow-up.A regular screening of post-ICU patients after discharge from hospital should be an integral part of aftercare management.

Predictors included demographic- and admission-related characteristics and hypothesized risk factors for developing stress-related mental health disorders. The mean score for acute stress symptoms during the ICU stay was 40.3 (sd = 13.8) and 59 family members in total met diagnostic screening criteria for ASD during hospitalization (15.6%). At 3-month follow-up, the mean score for posttraumatic stress symptoms was 30.8 (sd = 12.9) and 52 family members met diagnostic criteria for PTSD (13.8%). Factors associated with meeting ASD screening criteria were unplanned admission and poorer family relationships. Factors associated with PTSD symptoms and diagnosis were longer length of stay, meeting ASD criteria during admission, child's death, and less perceived social support.Meeting screening criteria for PTSD was associated with demographic, length of stay, and family relationships among family members of seriously ill children. PTSD outcomes were higher among family members whose child died. This study helps identify risk factors that can be used to target needed psychosocial screening, monitoring and support during and following a prolonged PICU admission, as well as family-centered interventions and supportive bereavement intervention for the family members of a deceased child.",370

In recent years, there has been a rise in ESM/EMA studies in the traumatic stress field (Greene et al., 2018; Chun, 2016; Kleindienst et al., 2017). ESM/EMA approaches enable researchers to ask and answer questions that are not typically possible using traditional methods, such as: How variable is PTSD symptomatology in daily life? Which symptoms and behaviours predict other symptoms and behaviours a few hours later? What is the real-time effect of environmental stressors on mental health? What are the temporal dynamics of symptoms during treatment? (Greene, Gelkopf, Fried, Robinaugh, & Lapid Pickman, 2020; Hoffart, Langkaas, Øktedalen, & Johnson, 2019).Objectives: The objective of the current study was to investigate the dynamic interactions of traumatic symptoms during and after stress exposure using a prospective multi-wave ESM/EMA design.Methods: In this study, 182 Israeli civilians exposed to rocket fire, including 86 with a history of serious mental illness, completed assessments twice daily for 30 days via mobile phone during the Israel-Gaza 2014 conflict (July-August). Three ESM/EMA follow up bursts were conducted 1.5, 3.5, and nearly 6 years later. Respondents completed ESM versions of the PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 (PHQ-9), and other questions relating to dissociation, perceived threat, social support, and stress exposure. A series of analyses were conducted using R, Mplus and SPSS, including dynamic network analyses, dynamic structural equation models (DSEM), and multilevel mediation analyses.Results: In the peritraumatic phase, dynamic network analyses found that arousal symptoms predicted other PTSD symptoms, as well as negative affect. A multilevel mediation model showed that perceived threat mediated the relationship between stress exposure and traumatic stress symptoms (Lapid Pickman, Greene, & Gelkop, 2017). In the posttraumatic phase (3.5 year follow up), a DSEM found dynamic associations between PTSD and depression symptoms, with elevations in PTSD symptoms predicting elevations in depression symptoms 12 hours later, but not vice versa.Conclusions: ESM/EMA approaches can provide novel insights into the complex and dynamic interactions of PTSD symptoms in daily life, both those that are part of the core PTSD symptomatology, and also with comorbid phenomena, such as perceived threat, negative affect, and depression.",371

Methods This was a prospective, cohort design with a 3-month follow-up. Black adult male trauma patients were enrolled at an urban, Level 1 trauma center. The Penn Richmond Screener and the Posttraumatic Adjustment Scale (PAS) were collected in-hospital. Participants were categorized as depressed using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self Report and as positive for PTSD using the PTSD Check List – 5 (PCL-5) at 3-months post-discharge. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of each screener were calculated. We used receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) with 95% CI to assess predictive performance of each screener. Results A cohort of 623 hospitalized, injured Black men were enrolled during acute hospitalization. 503 participants (80.6%) were retained at 3-months and formed the analytic sample. Mean age was 36.8 years (SD 15.4), 53.1% of injuries were intentional; median injury severity score was 9. At 3 months, 35.3% had moderate to severe depression, 32.7% had significant PTSD symptoms, and 22.4% met criteria for both depression and PTSD. Penn Richmond Screener: sensitivity 0.68, specificity 0.56, and AUC 0.62 for PTSD, and sensitivity 0.64, specificity 0.63, and AUC 0.64 for depression. PAS: sensitivity 0.59, specificity 0.73, and AUC 0.66 for PTSD, and sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.49, and AUC 0.62 for depression. Conclusions This study validated the performance of both screeners within the same population, allowing a direct comparison. Two predictive screeners, developed through different methods and in different countries, showed comparable predictive ability. These findings indicate that risk markers for adverse psychological consequences of traumatic injury share some core similarities across populations and countries.",372

Objective To identify (predictors of) trajectories of PCBD, PTSD, and depression in disaster-bereaved people (study 1) and to examine temporal associations between PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptoms (study 2). Method In study 1, distress-trajectories were identified using latent class growth modelling. People (N = 172) whose significant other died due to MH17 disaster completed PCBD, PTSD, and depression questionnaires 11, 22, 31, and 42 months after the disaster. Predictors of trajectories were examined with logistic regression. In study 2, the same data were used to examine temporal associations between symptoms, using cross-lagged analysis. Results In study 1, a Mild (81.8%) and Chronic (18.2%) PCBD class emerged. For PTSD and depression we found a Mild (85.2% and 85.6%), Recovered (4.4% and 8.2%), and Chronic trajectory (10.3% and 6.2%). A lower educational level predicted chronic trajectories. In study 2, changes in PCBD symptoms had a greater impact on changes in PTSD and depression symptoms than vice versa. Conclusions In Study 1 we found support for differential trajectories and predictors across the outcomes, suggesting that different symptom-profiles post-loss may need different treatment approaches. Study 2’s findings run counter to the notion that PTSD and depression symptoms should be addressed before grief in treatment. We suggest that early screening and treatment of elevated grief is pivotal in preventing long-lasting distress.",373

Medical trauma and post‐traumatic stress (PTS) are emerging as important considerations in patients with digestive illness. To date, no study assesses medical PTS from procedures in patients with esophageal disease. Methods Adult patients with achalasia, eosinophilic esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or functional esophageal disease at a university‐based gastroenterology clinic completed: Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5), Gastroesophageal Disease Questionnaire, Brief Esophageal Dysphagia Questionnaire, Northwestern Esophageal Quality of Life scale (HRQoL), NIH‐PROMIS Depression scale, and a study‐specific questionnaire about esophageal procedures (endoscopy with sedation; functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) with sedation; high‐resolution manometry (HRM); wireless pH testing; or 24‐h pH‐impedance testing). Key Results Half of 149 participants reported at least one traumatic procedure, with HRM most often cited. Only 2.7% met the cutoff for PTS on PCL‐5. This increased to 7.1% for patients with a traumatic procedure combined with experiencing intense fear. Rates of moderate–severe PTS ranged from 7.4%–12% for all patients and 14%–29% for those with a traumatic procedure with fear. Medical PTS was associated with poorer HRQoL, and increased esophageal symptoms, depression, and hypervigilance and symptom anxiety. Conclusions &amp; Inferences Preliminary evidence suggests medical PTS affects few patients with esophageal disease. However traumatic procedures, most often associated with HRM, significantly increase PTS symptoms. The potential impacts of medical PTS on esophageal patient assessment and outcomes are considerable and warrants further study.",374

https://openalex.org/W2486826274,10.1002/jts.22119,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in U.S. Military Primary Care: Trajectories and Predictors of One‐Year Prognosis,"We examined the longitudinal course of primary care patients in the active duty Army with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and identified prognostic indicators of PTSD severity. Data were drawn from a 6-site randomized trial of collaborative primary care for PTSD and dpression in the military. Subjects were 474 soldiers with PTSD (scores ≥ 50 on the PTSD Checklist -Civilian Version). Four assessments were completed at U.S. Army installations: baseline, and follow-ups at 3 months (92.8% response rate [RR]), 6 months (90.1% RR), and 12 months (87.1% RR). Combat exposure and 7 validated indicators of baseline clinical status (alcohol misuse, depression, pain, somatic symptoms, low mental health functioning, low physical health functioning, mild traumatic brain injury) were used to predict PTSD symptom severity on the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (Cronbach's α = .87, .92, .95, .95, at assessments 1-4, respectively). Growth mixture modeling identified 2 PTSD symptom trajectories: subjects reporting persistent symptoms (Persisters, 81.9%, n = 388), and subjects reporting improved symptoms (Improvers 18.1%, n = 86). Logistic regression modeling examined baseline predictors of symptom trajectories, adjusting for demographics, installation, and treatment condition. Subjects who reported moderate combat exposure, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.44, 95% CI [0.20, 0.98], or who reported high exposure, OR = 0.39, 95% CI [0.17, 0.87], were less likely to be Improvers. Other baseline clinical problems were not related to symptom trajectories. Findings suggested that most military primary care patients with PTSD experience persistent symptoms, highlighting the importance of improving the effectiveness of their care. Most indicators of clinical status offered little prognostic information beyond the brief assessment of combat exposure.",376

Advanced Integrative Therapy (AIT), a novel treatment, was used to treat a case of C-PTSD. The client’s chief concern was a flare-up of anxiety, relational distress, and fibromyalgia that occurred when they (chosen pronoun) accepted custody of their nephew. Over a span of nine 90-minute sessions, the clinician assessed progress using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) to measure PTSD symptoms; the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ; Cloitre et al., 2018), which measures C-PTSD symptoms according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision (ICD-11); the Child-Parent Relationship Scale (CPRS; Pianta, 1992), which measures connection and conflict in the caregiver-child relationship; and the Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) scale (Wolpe, 1969), which rates the client’s current level of distress or discomfort. The clinician also used the self-report questionnaire Helpful Aspects of Therapy (HAT; Llewelyn et al., 1988) and the Change Interview (CI) method (Elliott et al., 2001) to measure client experience and perspective. After treatment with AIT, the client no longer met criteria for C-PTSD and showed dramatic improvement in intergenerational relationship satisfaction. In addition, there was a rapid reduction of hard to eradicate C-PTSD symptoms as well as reduction in the quantity and intensity of fibromyalgia induced pain. Use of AIT with caregivers could interrupt the transmission of intergenerational trauma thereby reducing or preventing ACEs by increasing emotional regulation and resilience.",377

However, different patients are identified depending on the diagnostic system used. Moreover, it is unclear if the conceptualizations of PTSD are differently associated with outcomes of pain rehabilitation. Hence, the aims of the present study were first to explore the prevalence rates and diagnostic agreement of probable PTSD according to the ICD-11 and the DSM-5 screening tools (International Trauma Questionnaire [ITQ] vs. PTSD Checklist [PCL-5]), and secondly, to explore the associations of probable PTSD determined by ITQ and PCL-5 with psychological distress measures at baseline, and thirdly, the associations with pain and disability after pain rehabilitation adjusting for psychological covariates.A consecutive cohort of patients with chronic non-malignant pain (n = 152) referred to a Danish interdisciplinary pain center was assessed at baseline prior to their first visit and at follow-up three days after completed treatment.The estimated probable PTSD baseline prevalence rates were 15.8% (ITQ) and 16.4% (PCL-5). However, the diagnostic agreement between the PCL-5 and the ITQ was only moderate (k = 0.64). Overall, compared to the ITQ probable PTSD according to the PCL-5 correlated more strongly with psychological distress. Only the ITQ was associated with poorer outcomes after rehabilitation, explaining alone 7-8% of the variance in disability and pain intensity adjusted for covariates.The results underline the importance of taking the conceptualization and assessment of PTSD into consideration when investigating the impact of PTSD on pain rehabilitation.There is a high prevalence of probable PTSD in patients with chronic pain. However, different patients with probable PTSD are identified depending on the diagnostic system used. Although similar probable PTSD prevalence rates (about 16%) were found using DSM-5 and ICD-11 PTSD screening tools (PCL-5 and ITQ, respectively), the diagnostic agreement between the systems was only moderate (k = 0.64). At the same time, only probable PTSD estimated according to the ITQ and not the PCL-5 was a significant predictor of disability after pain rehabilitation.",379
https://openalex.org/W3020727739,10.1111/jcpp.13240,Prevalence and predictive value of ICD‐11 post‐traumatic stress disorder and Complex PTSD diagnoses in children and adolescents exposed to a single‐event trauma,"The 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) made a number of significant changes to the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We sought to determine the prevalence and 3-month predictive values of the new ICD-11 PTSD criteria relative to ICD-10 PTSD, in children and adolescents following a single traumatic event. ICD-11 also introduced a diagnosis of Complex PTSD (CPTSD), proposed to typically result from prolonged, chronic exposure to traumatic experiences, although the CPTSD diagnostic criteria do not require a repeated experience of trauma. We therefore explored whether children and adolescents demonstrate ICD-11 CPTSD features following exposure to a single-incident trauma.Data were analysed from a prospective cohort study of youth aged 8-17 years who had attended an emergency department following a single trauma. Assessments of PTSD, CPTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms were performed at two to four weeks (n = 226) and nine weeks (n = 208) post-trauma, allowing us to calculate and compare the prevalence and predictive value of ICD-10 and ICD-11 PTSD criteria, along with CPTSD. Predictive abilities of different diagnostic thresholds were undertaken using positive/negative predictive values, sensitivity/specificity statistics and logistic regressions.At Week 9, 15 participants (7%) were identified as experiencing ICD-11 PTSD, compared to 23 (11%) experiencing ICD-10 PTSD. There was no significant difference in comorbidity rates between ICD-10 and ICD-11 PTSD diagnoses. Ninety per cent of participants with ICD-11 PTSD also met criteria for at least one CPTSD feature. Five participants met full CPTSD criteria.Reduced prevalence of PTSD associated with the use of ICD-11 criteria is likely to reduce identification of PTSD relative to using ICD-10 criteria but not relative to DSM-4 and DSM-5 criteria. Diagnosis of CPTSD is likely to be infrequent following single-incident trauma.",380

The goal of this systematic review was to synthesize research on the psychometric properties of the PCL-5 to guide clinical and research applications. We focused on reliability, validity, factor structure, optimal cutoff scores, and sensitivity to clinical change indices. A systematic review of the literature following PRISMA guidelines was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and PTSDpubs with search terms capturing selected psychometric indices of the PCL-5. The inclusion criteria were: peer-reviewed publication in English; primary focus on the PCL-5 psychometrics; empirical study; and study with adult samples. The search yielded 265 studies; 56 papers (amounting to 64 studies) met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Findings generally indicated evidence for: acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability; construct validity; a 7-factor Hybrid Model; recommended cutoff scores between 31-33; and ability to index sensitivity to clinical change. To further advance knowledge and applications of the PCL-5, we need more research on abbreviated versions of the PCL-5, bifactor modeling as applied to the PCL-5, as well as on PCL-5 item difficulty estimates, discrimination parameters, and clinical change score estimates.",382

The main objective of this study was to systematically identify predictors of SD among veterans with PTSD. Methods: Three hundred veterans with PTSD were included in the cross-sectional study. The subjects were assessed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and self-report questionnaires: PCL-5, i.e., PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) with Criterion A, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), and Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS). Several hierarchical multiple regressions were performed to test for the best prediction models for outcome variables of different types of SD. Results: 65% of participants received a provisional diagnosis of SD. All tested prediction models showed a good model fit. The significant individual predictors were cluster D (Trauma-Related Negative Alterations in Cognition and Mood) symptoms (for all types of SD) and in a relationship status/relationship satisfaction (all, except for premature ejaculation (PE)). Conclusions: The most salient implication of this study is the importance of sexual health assessment in veterans with PTSD. Therapeutic interventions should be focused on D symptoms and intended to improve relationship functioning with the aim to lessen the rates of SD. Psychotropic treatment with fewer adverse sexual effects is of utmost importance if pharmacotherapy is applied. Appropriate prevention, screening, and treatment of medical conditions could improve sexual functioning in veterans with PTSD.",383

Assessments also included the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to examine post-traumatic stress symptoms and probable PTSD. Nineteen HCWs fulfilled the TALS-SR again after three weeks from baseline for test-retest reliability.This study provides evidence of good internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the Spanish version of the TALS-SR. Strong support for the internal validity structure was obtained, with positive and significant correlations between the five symptomatologic domains and the symptomatologic total score. Significant and good correlations between the TALS-SR symptomatologic domains and the IES-R total and single domains' scores were found. The Questionnaire also demonstrated to discriminate between subjects with and without PTSD, with subjects with PTSD showing significantly higher mean scores in each domain of the TALS-SR.This study validates the Spanish version of TALS-SR, providing a useful instrument for a spectrum approach to PTSD and confirms the potential utility of this psychometric tool in both clinical practice and research settings.",384
https://openalex.org/W3201772630,10.3389/fnhum.2021.742198,Acute White Matter Integrity Post-trauma and Prospective Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms,"Background: Little is known about what distinguishes those who are resilient after trauma from those at risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous work indicates white matter integrity may be a useful biomarker in predicting PTSD. Research has shown changes in the integrity of three white matter tracts-the cingulum bundle, corpus callosum (CC), and uncinate fasciculus (UNC)-in the aftermath of trauma relate to PTSD symptoms. However, few have examined the predictive utility of white matter integrity in the acute aftermath of trauma to predict prospective PTSD symptom severity in a mixed traumatic injury sample. Method: Thus, the current study investigated acute brain structural integrity in 148 individuals being treated for traumatic injuries in the Emergency Department of a Level 1 trauma center. Participants underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 2 weeks post-trauma and completed several self-report measures at 2-weeks (T1) and 6 months (T2), including the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-V (CAPS-5), post-injury. Results: Consistent with previous work, T1 lesser anterior cingulum fractional anisotropy (FA) was marginally related to greater T2 total PTSD symptoms. No other white matter tracts were related to PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that in a traumatically injured sample with predominantly subclinical PTSD symptoms at T2, acute white matter integrity after trauma is not robustly related to the development of chronic PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest the timing of evaluating white matter integrity and PTSD is important as white matter differences may not be apparent in the acute period after injury.",385
https://openalex.org/W4210287213,10.1016/j.beth.2022.01.014,Impact of Treatment Setting and Format on Symptom Severity Following Cognitive Processing Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Preliminary data suggest cognitive processing therapy (CPT) significantly reduces posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity among military personnel and veterans when delivered over 12 days and combined with daily recreational activities (Bryan et al., 2018). The present study aimed to examine how therapy pace (i.e., daily vs. weekly sessions) and setting (i.e., clinic vs. recreational) impacts change in PTSD symptom severity. Forty-five military personnel and veterans diagnosed with PTSD chose to receive CPT (a) daily at a recreational facility with recreational programming, (b) daily on a university campus without recreational programming, and (c) weekly on a university campus without recreational programming. PTSD symptom severity was assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Reductions in CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores were large and statistically significant across all three settings (Cohen's ds > 2.1). As compared to reductions in CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores in daily therapy at a recreational facility (CAPS-5: d = 1.63-2.40; PCL-5: d = 1.99-2.17), reductions in CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores were significantly larger in daily therapy on campus, CAPS-5: t(80) = -2.9, p = .005, d = 2.23-2.69; PCL-5: t(78) = 2.6, p = .010, d = 2.54-4.43, but not weekly therapy on campus, CAPS-5: t(80) = 0.2, p = .883, d = 1.04-2.47; PCL-5: t(78) = 1.0, p = .310, d = 1.77-3.44. Participants receiving daily therapy on campus and weekly therapy on campus also had higher rates of clinically significant improvement and good end-state functioning. Results support the effectiveness of CPT across multiple treatment settings and formats and suggest that daily CPT may be less effective when delivered in combination with recreational activities.",386

However, there is not much research on what makes a traumatic event central to one’s life story. One reason a traumatic memory becomes a reference point for one’s life story is that it brings about significant changes in one’s life. This study investigated the relationships between transitional impact of an event, event centrality, and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, it tested whether higher negative changes were associated with higher levels of event centrality and PTSD symptoms. It also investigated whether event centrality mediated the relationship between transitional impact and PTSD severity.Methods: 101 individuals diagnosed with PTSD completed the Transitional Impact Scale (TIS), Centrality of Event Scale, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised regarding their traumatic experiences. Furthermore, they responded to the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale-Self Report (PSS-SR), Traumatic Events Checklist (TELC), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).Results and Conclusions: Results indicate that (a) the TIS had valid and reliable psychometric properties in a PTSD sample, (b) most of the traumatic events received high negative psychological and material change scores, and (c) event centrality mediated the relationship between transitional impact and PTSD severity.",387

We then compared these results to published interim results for the subsequent full-scale RCT. The analytic sample included women Veterans (N = 41) with PTSD related to MST accessing healthcare in a southeastern Veterans Affairs Health Care System. The majority were African American, non-Hispanic (80.5 %). The protocol-driven group interventions, Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY; n = 17) and the evidence-based control condition, CPT (n = 24), were delivered weekly for 10 and 12 sessions, respectively. Multilevel linear models (MLM) were used to compare changes over time between the two groups. The primary outcomes presented here are PTSD symptom severity and diagnosis, assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Symptom Checklist (PCL) total scores. PTSD symptom severity on both clinician-administered (CAPS) and self-reported (PCL) measures, improved significantly (p < .005) over time, with large within group effect sizes (0.90–0.99) consistent with the subsequent RCT. Participants in the TCTSY group showed clinically meaningful improvements earlier than the CPT group participants from baseline on the CAPS and PCL Total scores. Results support published findings of the effectiveness of TCTSY in the treatment for PTSD related to MST among women Veterans, particularly African American women. TCTSY warrants consideration as an adjunctive, precursor, or concurrent treatment to evidence-based psychotherapies. Future research should include patient preference, men with sexual trauma, and civilian populations.",389

Methods: We conducted a cohort study between March and May 2020 at the Lille University Hospital (France), including all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Psychological distress symptoms were measured 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-6 items (IES-6). The evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) took place 1 month later. Bivariate analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between PCL-5 scores and the demographic and health variables. The significant variables were then introduced into a multivariable linear regression analysis to establish their relative contributions to the severity of PTSD symptoms. Results: 180 patients were included in this study, and 138 patients completed the 2 evaluations. Among the 180 patients, 70.4% patients required hospitalization, and 30.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit. The prevalence of PTSD was 6.5%, and the predictive factors of PTSD included psychological distress at the onset of the illness and a stay in an intensive care unit. Conclusions: The prevalence of PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not as high as that reported among patients during previous epidemics. Initial psychological responses were predictive of a PTSD diagnosis, even though most patients showing acute psychological distress (33.5% of the sample) improved in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms also increased following a stay in an intensive care unit. Future studies should assess the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on patients†mental health.",390

A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science) was conducted to identify longitudinal studies examining the link between acute posttraumatic stress and physical and mental health. Inclusion criteria required assessment of acute posttraumatic stress (<1 month post-event) and at least one follow-up assessment of a physical or mental health outcome (not PTSD). 1,051 articles were screened; 22 met inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies examined physical health outcomes and 12 examined non-PTSD mental health outcomes. Early psychological responses to trauma were associated with a variety of short- (<1 year) and long- (≥1 year) term physical and mental health outcomes. Physical health outcomes included poor general physical health, increased pain and disability, lower quality of life, and higher risk of all-cause mortality. Significant psychological outcomes included more cumulative psychiatric disorders, depression, and anxiety. Significant psychosocial outcomes included increased family conflict. Methodologically rigorous longitudinal studies support the utility of measuring acute psychological responses to traumatic events as they may be an important marker of preventable trauma-related morbidity and mortality that warrants long-term monitoring and/or early intervention.",391
https://openalex.org/W4378611736,10.1093/sleep/zsad077.0152,0152 Natural disaster experiences and their varying impact on sleep impairment,"Abstract Introduction As rates and severity of natural disasters increase due to climate change, it is crucial to consider their effects on mental health. Among Hurricane Katrina survivors, stressors experienced following the Hurricane, including financial losses, were more robustly predictive of rates of PTSD than traumatic experiences occurring during the Hurricane (Galea et al., 2008). Because sleep disturbance is intimately associated with trauma exposure and has been implicated in the etiology of PTSD, we examined relationships between experiences during and after Hurricane Harvey (a historic storm that hit Texas in 2017) and sleep disturbance in sample of college students impacted by the storm. Methods Undergraduate students (N = 191, age: M = 21.25, SD = 3.14) at the University of Houston completed online surveys 6-8 months after Hurricane Harvey. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms were measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, excluding sleep items. Participants also reported on experiences/events during, immediately after, and in the weeks/months following the Hurricane. Total traumatic experiences during the Hurricane (e.g., thinking oneself or others would get hurt or die) and stressful experiences after the storm (e.g., losing power, damage to car or property) were calculated. Financial stress was examined as a unique predictor. Analyses controlled for total traumatic life events measured with the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5. Results In a multiple linear regression model, we tested whether traumatic experiences during, stressors after, and financial stressors due to the Hurricane predicted global PSQI score, controlling for other traumatic life experiences and total PTS symptoms. The overall model was significant (R2 = 0.22, F (5,185) = 10.48, p &amp;lt; .000). Traumatic experiences during the Hurricane (B = 0.37, p = 0.04), but not stressors (B = 0.02, p = 0.87) or financial stress (B = -0.29, p = 0.67) following the Hurricane significantly predicted poor sleep quality at present. Conclusion Our findings suggest that among a sample of young adult college students impacted by Hurricane Harvey, traumatic experiences during the storm were the most robust predictor of sleep disturbance several months later even after accounting for PTS symptoms.

Although the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) has been used in India, no study has adapted the measure in full for use with this population. This study describes the adaptation, validation, and results from the adapted HTQ, containing the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), for Indian women from slums reporting GBV. Method : This study used the adaptation framework proposed by the HTQ measure developers. The adapted HTQ contained a (1) trauma screen relevant for stressors faced by Indian women from slums, (2) description of the index trauma, (3) description of any ongoing stressors, (4) universal trauma reactions (i.e., PTSD measured by the PCL-5), and culturally relevant trauma reactions (i.e., idioms of distress measured by a scale developed for the study). This measure was piloted on 111 women from Indian slums in face-to-face interviews. Trauma characteristics, types of ongoing stressors, and psychometric properties of the PCL-5 and idioms of distress scale were explored. These scales were validated against measures of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and somatic complaints (PHQ-9). Results : The majority of participants (77%) reported physical beatings, 18% reported unwanted sexual touch, and 28.8% reported infidelity as the primary emotional abuse. Further, 96.7% of GBV was perpetrated by partner or family member and over half reported ongoing stressors (e.g., poverty-related strain). The PCL-5 embedded in the HTQ yielded good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=.88) as did the idioms of distress scale with deletion of one item (Cronbach’s alpha=.80). Both scales were externally valid, yielding large correlations with depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints ( r s between .54 to .80, p s &lt; .05). Discussion : This is the first study to develop a comprehensive measure of trauma exposure with universal and culturally relevant reactions in India. This study also enhances HTQ usage in India by delineating all the steps in the adaptation process. Results can inform the development of trauma-focused interventions for Indian women from slums.",393

This included 300 men (66%) and 152 women with mean age 43.8 years and mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) 11.3, with 83% having fractures of the pelvis and/or extremities. Medical and injury related variables were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of screening positive for PTSD.Prevalence and risk factors for screening positive for PTSD amongst the trauma patient population.Twenty-six percent of trauma patients screened positive for PTSD after mean 86 days following injury. These patients were younger (35 vs 46 years old, P < 0.001) and more commonly African American (56% vs 43% Caucasian, P < 0.001). Pedestrians struck by motor vehicles (OR 4.70, P = 0.040) and victims of crime (OR 4.12, P = 0.013) were more likely to screen positive. Psychiatric history, injury severity (ISS), and injury type did not predict positive screening.One-in-four patients suffering traumatic injuries screened positive for PTSD suggesting the prevalence of PTSD among trauma patients far exceeds that of the general population. Predictive factors included victims of crime and pedestrians struck by motor vehicles. Screening measures are needed in orthopaedic trauma surgery clinics to refer these at-risk patients for proper evaluation and treatment.Prognostic; Level II.",394

It’s therefore important to examine the validity of CPTSD in refugee groups exposed to complex trauma (CT) defined as a repeated, prolonged, interpersonal traumatic event.Objective: The objective of this study was to compare DSM-5 and ICD-11 post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses and to evaluate the discriminant validity of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD constructs in a sample of treatment-seeking refugees living in Italy.Method: The study sample included 120 treatment-seeking African refugees living in Italy. All participants were survivors of at least one CT. PTSD and CPTSD diagnoses were assessed according to both DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria.Results: Findings revealed that 79% of the participants met the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD, 38% for ICD-11 PTSD and 30% for ICD-11 CPTSD. Generally, ICD-11 CPTSD items evidenced strong sensitivity and negative predictive power, low specificity and positive predictive power. Latent class analysis results identified two distinct groups: (1) a PTSD class, (2) a CPTSD class. None of the demographic and trauma-related variables analysed was significantly associated with diagnostic group. On the other hand, the months spent in Italy were significantly associated with PCL-5 score.Conclusions: Findings extend the current evidence base to support the discriminant validity of PTSD and CPTSD amongst refugees exposed to torture and other gross violations of human rights. The results suggest also that, in the post-traumatic phase, the time spent in a ‘safe place’ condition contributes to improve the severity of post-traumatic symptomatology, but neither this variable nor other socio-demographic factors seem to contribute to the emergence of complex PTSD. Further investigations are needed to clarify which specific vulnerability factors influence the development of PTSD or CPTSD in refugees exposed to complex trauma.",395

PTSD includes anxiety, flashbacks, and emotional numbing. The symptoms increase health care costs for stress-related illnesses and can make veterans’ civilian life difficult. We used a randomized wait-list controlled design with repeated measures of U.S. military veterans to address our specific aim to test the efficacy of a 6-week therapeutic horseback riding (THR) program for decreasing PTSD symptoms and increasing coping self-efficacy, emotion regulation, social and emotional loneliness. Fifty-seven participants were recruited and 29 enrolled in the randomized trial. They were randomly assigned to either the horse riding group (n = 15) or a wait-list control group (n = 14). The wait-list control group experienced a 6-week waiting period, while the horse riding group began THR. The wait-list control group began riding after 6 weeks of participating in the control group. Demographic and health history information was obtained from all the participants. PTSD symptoms were measured using the standardized PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M). The PCL-M as well as other instruments including, The Coping Self Efficacy Scale (CSES), The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and The Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults-short version (SELSA) were used to access different aspects of individual well-being and the PTSD symptoms. Participants had a statistically significant decrease in PTSD scores after 3 weeks of THR (P ≤ 0.01) as well as a statistically and clinically significant decrease after 6 weeks of THR (P ≤ 0.01). Logistic regression showed that participants had a 66.7% likelihood of having lower PTSD scores at 3 weeks and 87.5% likelihood at 6 weeks. Under the generalized linear model(GLM), our ANOVA findings for the coping self-efficacy, emotion regulation, and social and emotional loneliness did not reach statistical significance. The results for coping self-efficacy and emotion regulation trended in the predicted direction. Results for emotional loneliness were opposite the predicted direction. Logistic regression provided validation that outcome effects were caused by riding longer. The findings suggest that THR may be a clinically effective intervention for alleviating PTSD symptoms in military veterans.",396

Study Design The APCTSS was developed by combining and adapting the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-5 with the adult Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5. Adolescent medicine patients were universally approached during clinic visits. With a response rate of 83.6%, 178 patients aged 13-22 (M=18.4, SD=2.3), 64.4% female; 62.1% Black or African-American and 20.7% Hispanic/Latinx, were enrolled. Patients completed APCTSS, Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A), and Child PTSD Symptom Scale for DSM-5 Interview (CPSS-5-I), and 61 completed the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory for Children (TESI-C). Results 56.7% reported a criterion A trauma, 30.1% met criteria for PTSD, 7.4% met criteria for subsyndromal PTSD, and 19.0% for post-event impairing symptoms. Scores ≥ 2 on the APCTSS optimized sensitivity (.79; 95% CI=.66 to .89) and specificity (.68; 95% CI=.55 to .76) for PTSD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of .79. Sensitivity (.86; 95% CI=.65 to .90), specificity (.77; 95% CI=.60 to .90), and AUC (.86) were even stronger when the TESI-C was used to assess criterion A for PTSD diagnosis. Over half (56.0%) of patients who screened positive on the APCTSS were missed by the PHQ-A. Conclusions The APCTSS shows promise as an internally consistent, valid, and effective tool for identifying adolescents at high risk of PTSD and traumatic stress.",397

There is a need for a Danish language version of the International Trauma Questionnaire - Child and Adolescent (ITQ-CA) to assess symptoms of PTSD and CPTSD.Objective: To test the ICD-11 formulations of PTSD and DSO (Disturbances of Self-Organization) using the ITQ-CA version in a sample of children exposed to abuse. Additionally, to study the distribution of symptoms and probable prevalence of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD among the population of children exposed to violence or sexual abuse.Method: Confirmatory factor analysis of competing models of the dimensionality of the ITQ-CA was tested among a sample of 119 children and adolescents that were referred to the Danish Children Centres on suspicion of physical or sexual abuse or both. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to study the distribution of symptoms and consequences of different operationalisations of functional impairment were explored.Results: Findings supported a two-factor second-order model corresponding to the operationalisation of CPTSD in ICD-11 as the best representation of the data. Findings from the LCA suggested that symptoms were distributed in a pattern consistent with the ICD-11 proposal for CPTSD. CPTSD was more prevalent than PTSD regardless of the operationalisation of functional impairment.Conclusion: ITQ-CA is a valid tool for identifying symptoms of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD among Danish children exposed to physical or sexual abuse. Further research is needed to study the relationship between ICD-11 C/PTSD symptomatology and anxiety and depression in this population.The International Trauma Questionnaire – Child and Adolescent version (ITQ-CA) is a valid measure of symptoms of ICD-11 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD among Danish children exposed to physical or sexual violence.The structure of the ITQ-CA in the Danish sample reflects the ICD-11 diagnostic algorithm.CPTSD is a more prevalent disorder among children recently exposed to violence than PTSD.",398

Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the type of trauma on the severity of symptoms, anxiety, depression, and dissociative experiences in the PTSD patient population. Method: The sample of the study consists of 80 volunteer PTSD patients (20 sexual trauma, 20 work accidents, 20 traffic accidents and 20 combat related trauma). Once the severity of symptoms was determined in all subjects by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) were applied. Results: A statistically significant difference were found between trauma types with regard to age, time without treatment, and the total and subscale scores obtained in DES and CAPS. It was found that in the group that has PTSD diagnosis related to sexual trauma, the length of the time without treatment, DES and CAPS scores. Conclusion: The study we conducted showed that PTSD continued more severe and resistant after a sexual trauma. Moreover, specific type of trauma was significant in PTSD patients.",399

However, there is a lack of research exploring the clinical impact for highly dissociative groups receiving treatment for PTSD. The current study examined the presence and clinical impact of a dissociative subtype in a sample of individuals receiving treatment for chronic PTSD.This study used latent transition analyses (LTA), an expanded form of latent profile analyses (LPA), to examine latent profiles of PTSD and dissociation symptoms before and after treatment for individuals (N = 200) receiving prolonged exposure (PE) or sertraline treatment for chronic PTSD.The best fitting LTA model was one with a 4-class solution at both pretreatment and posttreatment. There was a latent class at pretreatment with higher levels of dissociative symptoms. However, this class was also marked by higher reexperiencing symptoms, and membership was not predicted by chronic child abuse. Further, although those in the class were less likely to transition to the responder class overall, this was not the case for exposure-based treatment specifically.These findings are not in line with the dissociative-subtype theoretical literature that proposes those who dissociate represent a clinically distinct group that may respond worse to exposure-based treatments for PTSD.

The present study extended previous research with a pilot trial of TM as a treatment for PTSD via a single-blinded, randomized controlled design. veterans with PTSD (N = 40) were assigned to a TM intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group. Participants in the TM group engaged in 16 sessions over 12 weeks, primarily in a 60-min group format. Change in PTSD symptoms, measured via the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included self-reported PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, anger, and quality of life (QoL). Assessments were conducted at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Mean CAPS-5 score decreases were significantly larger for participants in the TM group (M = -11.28, 95% CI [-17.35, -5.20]), compared to the TAU group (M = -1.62, 95% CI [-6.77, 3.52]), p = .012, d = -0.84. At posttest, 50.0% of veterans in the TM group no longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria as compared to 10.0% in the TAU group, p = .007. Adjusted mean changes on self-report measures of PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties indicated significant reductions in the TM group compared to TAU, ds = .80-1.16. There were no significant group differences regarding anger or QoL. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of TM as a treatment for veterans with PTSD and for comorbid symptoms. Combined with other research, they suggest that TM may be a tolerable, non-trauma-focused PTSD treatment.",401

One commonly cited impediment to these assessment approaches is the amount of time required for test administration and interpretation. Empirically keyed methods to reduce the administration time of structured assessments may be a viable solution to increase the use of standardized and reliable diagnostic tools. Thus, the present research conducted an initial feasibility study using a sample of treatment-seeking military veterans (N = 1,517) to develop a truncated assessment protocol based on the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS). Decision-tree analysis was utilized to identify a subset of predictor variables among the CAPS items that were most predictive of a diagnosis of PTSD. The algorithm-driven, atheoretical sequence of questions reduced the number of items administered by more than 75% and classified the validation sample at 92% accuracy. These results demonstrated the feasibility of developing a protocol to assess PTSD in a way that imposes little assessment burden while still providing a reliable categorization.",402

In some people this may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in others to positive psychological change (PPC), whereby a person's reactions to the challenge are beneficial. Little research has investigated PPC in people who have had head and neck cancer (HNC). The aim of this study was to identify demographic, clinical, and psychological factors associated with PPC over time. A cross-sequential study collected data over 5 years. Participants were sent the Silver Lining Questionnaire (SLQ; a measure of PPC), the University of Washington HNC quality of life measure, and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 12 each year. Additional data were collected from clinical records. Analysis using linear mixed-effects modelling revealed that participants with lower stage tumours and those who only had a surgical intervention reported greater PPC over time. Multivariable modelling adjusting for psychosocial variables found that PPC had a quadratic relationship with time since diagnosis, increasing initially and levelling off after 18 months. These findings build on the minimal PPC research with people following HNC. In particular it demonstrates a model of trajectories for the development of PPC longitudinally over time.",403

Predeployment assessment was conducted 4 months before deployment (T1). Of these, 1324 (70.8% retention rate) participated in assessment within 4 months after deployment (T2), and 1122 (60.0%) completed the third time point at 4 years after deployment (T3). PTSD symptoms were assessed with the posttraumatic stress checklist and physical symptoms with a 67-item self-report Health Symptom Checklist. To explore directional influences between symptoms over time, longitudinal cross-lagged association between the modeled latent factors for PTSD symptoms and physical symptoms was estimated using structural equation modeling.From T1 to T2, there was a significant bidirectional effect with higher physical symptom count at T1 predicting higher PTSD symptom severity at T2 ( β = 0.17, p < .001) and higher PTSD symptom severity at T1 predicting higher physical symptom count at T2 ( β = 0.13, p < .001). The effect of T2 on T3 was unidirectional. PTSD symptom severity at T2 had no effect on physical symptom count at T3, but physical symptom count at T2 predicted an increase in PTSD symptom severity at T3 ( β = 0.11, p = .013).Considering early physical symptoms and their physiological underpinnings after traumatic exposures could help identify those at risk of later PTSD.",406

Participants at Time 1 were 602 adults who reported directly experiencing a transportation accident within the past year ( M months = 6.36; SD months = 3.20). Of these participants, 171 adults completed the follow‐up survey after 3 months (Time 2). Finite mixture modeling was conducted to identify the heterogeneity of PTSS in relation with PGI at each time point. At Time 1, a four‐class model was the best‐fitting model, and at Time 2, a three‐class model was the best‐fitting model. As hypothesized, when examined cross‐sectionally, various subgroups were identified at each time point, finding subgroups with moderate to high levels of PGI but differing in their PTSS. However, when examining the longitudinal changes in class membership from Time 1 to Time 2, members of subgroups with higher PGI skills at Time 1 were more likely to be assigned to subgroups with lower PTSS at Time 2. The current study suggests a potential application of PGI skills in alleviating PTSS after a transportation accident and having a critical role in adjustment after hardship.",407

Several studies have conceptualized this as a traumatic stress response to challenging child behaviors such as self‐harm, suicidal ideation, and physical aggression toward caregivers. In the present study, we explored the relevance of a trauma‐based diagnostic framework to a sample of 30 mothers ( M age = 42.97, SD = 5.82) of children with ASD ( M age = 12.43, SD = 3.15). Participants were interviewed using the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale for DSM‐5 (CAPS‐5) for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and an abbreviated Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to assess for comorbidity. Three participants were excluded as they met criteria for PTSD from a traumatic event unrelated to their parenting experience. Of the remaining 27 participants, 6 (22.2%) met criteria for PTSD in the context of traumatic parenting experiences. Descriptions of traumatic events experienced are summarized. Results suggest that, for some parents, challenging child behaviors such as physical violence toward the caregiver from the child, self‐injurious behaviors, and suicidal behaviors function as traumatic stressors as per Criterion A of PTSD (American Psychiatric Association [2013]. Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders [DSM‐5] . Arlington, VA). This has implications for health professionals engaged with parents of children with ASD, who should consider the possibility of PTSD when challenging behaviors of a potentially traumatic nature are present.

Prior research examining the distinctiveness of PTSD and pathological grief focused on non-traumatic loss samples, used outdated conceptualizations of grief disorders, and has provided mixed results.In a large sample of traumatically bereaved people, we first evaluated the factor structure of PTSD and PGD separately and then evaluated the factor structure when combining PTSD and PGD symptoms to examine the distinctiveness between the two syndromes.Self-reported data were used from 468 people bereaved due to the MH17 plane disaster (N = 200) or a traffic accident (N = 268). The 10 DSM-5-TR PGD symptoms were assessed with the Traumatic Grief Inventory-Self Report Plus (TGI-SR+). The 20-item Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to tap PTSD symptoms. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted.For PTSD, a seven factor, so-called 'Hybrid' model yielded the best fit. For PGD, a univariate factor model fits the data well. A combined model with PGD items loading on one factor and PTSD items on seven factors (associations between PGD and PTSD subscales r ≥ .50 and ≤.71), plus a higher-order factor (i.e. PTSD factors on a higher-order PTSD factor) (association between higher-order PTSD factor and PGD factor r = .82) exhibited a better fit than a model with all PGD and PTSD symptom loading on a single factor or two factors (i.e. one for PGD and one for PTSD).This is the first study examining the factor structure of DSM-5-TR PGD and DSM-5 PTSD in people confronted with a traumatic loss. The findings provide support that PGD constitutes a syndrome distinguishable from, yet related with, PTSD.Antecedentes: El trastorno de duelo prolongado (PGD en su sigla en inglés) se incluyó recientemente en la revisión del texto del DSM-5 (DSM-5-TR). Hasta ahora, se desconoce si el PGD del DSM-5-TR se puede distinguir del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) relacionado con el duelo. Investigaciones anteriores que examinaron el carácter distintivo del trastorno de estrés postraumático y el duelo patológico se centraron en muestras con pérdidas no traumáticas, utilizaron conceptualizaciones obsoletas de los trastornos del duelo y arrojaron resultados mixtos.Objetivo: En una muestra grande de personas en duelo traumático, primero evaluamos la estructura factorial de TEPT y PGD por separado y luego evaluamos la estructura factorial al combinar los síntomas de TEPT y PGD para examinar la distinción entre los dos síndromes.Métodos: Se utilizaron datos autoreportados de 468 personas en duelo debido al desastre del avión MH17 (N = 200) o un accidente de tráfico (N = 268). Los 10 síntomas de PGD del DSM-5-TR se evaluaron con el Inventario de Autoreporte de Duelo Traumático Plus (TGI-SR +). Se utilizó la lista de chequeo de 20 ítems para el trastorno de estrés postraumático para el DSM-5 (PCL-5) para examinar los síntomas del TEPT. Se realizaron análisis factoriales confirmatorios.Resultados: Para el TEPT, un modelo de siete factores, llamado modelo ‘híbrido’, produjo el mejor ajuste. Para el PGD, un modelo de factor univariado se ajusta bien a los datos. Un modelo combinado con elementos de PGD que cargan en un factor y elementos de TEPT en siete factores (asociaciones entre las subescalas de PGD y TEPT r ≥ 50 y ≤ .71), más un factor de orden superior (es decir, factores de TEPT en un factor de TEPT de orden superior)) (asociación entre el factor TEPT de orden superior y el factor PGD r = .82) mostró un mejor ajuste que un modelo con toda la carga de síntomas de PGD y TEPT en un solo factor o dos factores (es decir, uno para PGD y otro para TEPT).Conclusiones: Este es el primer estudio que examina la estructura factorial del PGD según DSM-5-TR y el TEPT según DSM-5 en personas que enfrentan una pérdida traumática. Los hallazgos respaldan que el PGD constituye un síndrome que se distingue del TEPT, pero que está relacionado con él.背景: 延长哀伤障碍 (PGD) 被新纳入 DSM-5 (DSM-5-TR) 的文本修订版。到目前为止, 尚不清楚 DSM-5-TR PGD 是否可与丧亲相关的创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 区分开来。先前考查PTSD 和病理性哀伤区别的研究侧重于非创伤性丧亲样本, 使用了过时的哀伤障碍概念, 并提供了混杂的结果。目的: 在一个创伤性丧亲者群体的大样本中, 我们首先分别评估了 PTSD 和 PGD 的因子结构, 然后在结合 PTSD 和 PGD 症状时评估了因子结构, 以考查两种综合征之间的差异性。方法: 使用 468 名因 MH17 空难 (N = 200) 或交通事故 (N = 268) 而丧亲的人的自我报告数据。使用创伤性哀伤清单 - 自我报告 Plus (TGI-SR+) 评估10 个 DSM-5-TR PGD 症状。20 条目的DSM-5创伤后应激障碍检查表(PCL-5)用于考查PTSD 症状。进行了验证性因素分析。结果: 对于 PTSD, 七因素, 即所谓的‘混合’模型为最佳拟合。对于 PGD, 单变量因子模型可以很好地拟合数据。一个PGD 条目载荷于一个因素, PTSD 项目载荷于七个因素 (PGD 和 PTSD 分量表之间的关联 r≥ .50 并 ≤ .71), 加上一个高阶因素 (即PTSD 因素们之上的高阶 PTSD 因子) (高阶 PTSD 因子和 PGD 因素之间的关联 r= .82) 的混合模型, 表现出比所有 PGD 和 PTSD 症状加载到单个因子或两个因子 (即, 一个PGD和一个PTSD) 的模型更好的拟合。结论: 这是第一项在面临创伤性丧失的人中考查 DSM-5-TR PGD 和 DSM-5 PTSD因素结构的研究。研究结果支持 PGD 构成一种可与 PTSD 区分开来但与 PTSD 相关的综合征。.",411

This article describes the initial evaluation of a 15-item self-report measure of the subtype called the Dissociative Subtype of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale (DSPS) in an online survey of 697 trauma-exposed military veterans representative of the U.S. veteran population. Exploratory factor analyses of the lifetime DSPS items supported the intended structure of the measure consisting of three factors reflecting derealization/depersonalization, loss of awareness, and psychogenic amnesia. Consistent with prior research, latent profile analyses assigned 8.3% of the sample to a highly dissociative class distinguished by pronounced symptoms of derealization and depersonalization. Overall, results provide initial psychometric support for the lifetime DSPS scales; additional research in clinical and community samples is needed to further validate the measure.",412

Confirmatory factor analyses indicated almost the same excellent fit with both the six‐factor Anhedonia model and the seven‐factor Hybrid model. However, no significant difference in model fit was found between the two models, supporting the parsimonious six‐factor Anhedonia model. In addition, the total scale and six subscales of the PCL‐5 demonstrated good or acceptable internal consistency and good convergent and discriminant validity. These results provide additional evidence for expanding the use of the PCL‐5 with non‐English‐speaking adults exposed to natural disasters. Implications for the use of this questionnaire in assessment and treatment contexts are discussed.",413

Participants and method: Participants were 215 U.S. active duty service members recruited from Fort Bragg, NC as normal controls as part of a larger study. Participants completed the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) and Posttraumatic Checklist (PCL) twice, separated by approximately 30 days. Results: Depending on the endorsement level used (i.e. ratings of ‘mild’ or greater vs. ratings of ‘moderate’ or greater), approximately 2–15% of this sample met DSM-IV symptom criteria for Postconcussional Disorder across time points, while 1–6% met DSM-IV symptom criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Effect sizes for change from Time 1 to Time 2 on individual symptoms were small (Cohen’s d = .01 to .13). The test–retest reliability for the NSI total score was r = .78 and the PCL score was r = .70. An eight-point change in symptom reporting represented reliable change on the NSI total score, with a seven-point change needed on the PCL. Conclusions: Postconcussion-like symptoms are not unique to mild TBI and are commonly reported in a healthy soldier sample. It is important for clinicians to use normative data when evaluating a service member or veteran and when evaluating the likelihood that a change in symptom reporting is reliable and clinically meaningful.",414

Methods: Prior to PE therapy, veterans were administered a PTSD treatment expectations (PTE) survey consisting of three 11-point Likert scale questions with possible scores of 0-30. The primary outcome was changes in total PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) scores before and after PE therapy. ANOVA in repeated measures was used to evaluate the association between PTE tertiles and PTSD symptom changes.

Results: 57 veterans consented and 35 (61.4%) completed therapy. Mean differences in PCL-5 scores pre-/post-PE were 19.0, 14.4, and 31.1 (p<0.0006 for all) in the low (0-12), middle (13-20) and high (21-30) PTE tertiles, respectively.

Conclusions: Consistent with current literature, our study shows that PTSD outcome expectancy may be useful in predicting treatment response to PE.",415

Within-person analyses and the DSM-5 suggest that heterogeneity may also be evident within individuals across time as they move through social contexts and biological cycles. Modeling within-person symptom-level fluctuations may confirm such heterogeneity, elucidate mechanisms of disorder maintenance, and inform time- and person-specific interventions. The present study aimed to identify and predict discrete within-person disorder presentations, or symptom states, and explore group-level patterns of these states. Adults (N = 20, 60.0% male, M age = 38.25 years) with PTSD responded to symptom surveys four times per day for 30 days. We subjected each individual's dataset to Gaussian finite mixture modeling (GFMM) to uncover latent, within-person classes of symptom levels (i.e., states) and predicted those states with idiographic elastic net regularized regression using a set of time-based and behavioral predictors. Next, we conducted a GFMM of the within-person GFMM outputs and tested idiographic prediction models of these states. Multiple within-person states were revealed for 19 of 20 participants (Mdn = 4; 66 for the full sample). Prediction models were moderately successful, M AUC = .66 (d = 0.58), range: .50-1.00. The GFMM of the within-person model outputs revealed two states: one with above-average and one with below-average symptom levels. Prediction models were, again, moderately successful, M AUC = .66; range: .50-.89. The findings provide evidence for within-person heterogeneity of PTSD as well as between-person similarities and suggest that future work should incorporate additional contextual variables as symptom state predictors.",416

Following fundamental modifications in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5), the CAPS had to be revised. This study examined the psychometric properties (internal consistency, interrater reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and structural validity) of the German version of the CAPS-5 in a trauma-exposed sample ( n = 223 with PTSD; n =51 without PTSD). The results demonstrated high internal consistency (αs = .65-.93) and high interrater reliability (ICCs = .81-.89). With regard to convergent and discriminant validity, we found high correlations between the CAPS severity score and both the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale sum score ( r = .87) and the Beck Depression Inventory total score ( r = .72). Regarding the underlying factor structure, the hybrid model demonstrated the best fit, followed by the anhedonia model. However, we encountered some nonpositive estimates for the correlations of the latent variables (factors) for both models. The model with the best fit without methodological problems was the externalizing behaviors model, but the results also supported the DSM-5 model. Overall, the results demonstrate that the German version of the CAPS-5 is a psychometrically sound measure.",417

The pattern of post-traumatic stress symptoms plus life-impairing disturbances in self-organization (emotion dysregulation, negative self-concept and interpersonal problems) is termed Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD). Research about CPTSD after sexual assault in adolescents is limited owing to the challenges associated with assessing this group. This study aims to determine the frequency and structure of CPTSD, and the relationship of emotion dysregulation with impairment and additional trauma exposure among adolescents who have been sexually assaulted.Method: Prospective cohort study of adolescents attending the Sexual Assault Referral Centres serving London over a 2-year period. We conducted cross-sectional analyses (n = 99) on data collected 4–5 months after sexual assault, and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) and Latent Class Analyses (LCA) to determine the CPTSD profile. CTPSD was defined according to the ICD-11, selecting symptom indicators from the following measures: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13), Short version of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (S-MFQ), The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). We analysed the association of CPTSD symptom domains with impairment (measured with the SDQ, and the Children’s Global Assessment Scale; C-GAS) and with additional trauma exposure.Results: The frequency of ICD-11 PTSD was 59%, and of ICD-11 CPTSD was 40%. CPTSD symptoms showed a strong fit for a correlated 4-factor model, and LCA distinguished a class of participants with high levels of CPTSD symptoms. Emotion dysregulation was associated with impairment in functioning and exposure to trauma beyond other self-organization disturbances and core PTSD symptoms.Conclusions: Disturbances in self-organization are frequent in sexually assaulted adolescents, and emotion dysregulation is associated with impairment and further exposure to trauma. Emotion dysregulation should be considered in preventive and treatment strategies for these vulnerable youth.",418

The study also explores the buffering role of PTG on the associations between posttraumatic stress (PTS), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychological distress.A multicenter, longitudinal, prospective study was conducted among AYA cancer patients aged 14-39 years. One hundred sixty-nine patients completed a self-report measure of PTG (PTGI) and PTS (PDS) 6, 12, and 24 months after baseline (within the first 4 months of diagnosis). At 24-month follow-up, HRQoL (SF-36) and psychological distress (BSI-18) were also assessed.Among participants, 14% showed increasing PTG, 45% remained at a stable high PTG level, 14% showed decreasing PTG, and 27% remained at a stable low PTG level. AYAs who remained high on PTG were more often younger, female, and received chemotherapy. PTG level at 6-month follow-up was predictive of mental HRQoL (β = 0.19; p = 0.026) and psychological distress (β = -0.14; p = 0.043) at 24-month follow-up when corrected for PTS and sociodemographic and clinical covariates. No relationship between PTG and physical HRQoL was found. The interactive effects of PTS and PTG on outcomes were not significant, indicating that buffering did not take place.This study indicates that PTG is dynamic and predicts mental well-being outcomes but does not buffer the effects of PTS. Psychosocial interventions should focus on promoting PTG and reducing PTS in order to promote the adjustment of AYAs diagnosed with cancer.",419

Method This cross‐sectional design includes data from 278 veterans participating in a larger longitudinal research program of postdeployment recovery. Measures included self‐report questionnaires and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. Results Hierarchical regression was used to evaluate the independent contributions of deployment characteristics on long‐term PTSD symptoms after controlling for demographics and combat exposure. As expected, dwell time was a significant predictor of long‐term PTSD symptoms ( β = − 0.17, p = .042; F 5,108 = 8.21, ∆ R 2 = 0.03, p &lt; .001). Follow‐up analyses indicated that dwell time of less than 12 months was associated with significantly greater long‐term PTSD symptoms than those deployed once or with dwell time greater than 12 months. Conclusion In addition to combat exposure, time between deployments warrants clinical attention as an important deployment characteristic for predicting long‐term PTSD symptoms.",420
https://openalex.org/W3128621410,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.086,Understanding trajectories of underlying dimensions of posttraumatic psychopathology,"Research suggests four modal trajectories of psychological symptoms after traumatic injury: Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, Recovery. However, most studies focus on symptoms of psychiatric disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression), which are limited by heterogeneity and symptom overlap. We examined trajectories of cross-cutting posttraumatic symptom dimensions following traumatic injury and predictors of trajectory membership.In this longitudinal study of 427 predominantly Hispanic/Latino traumatic injury survivors, posttraumatic psychopathology symptoms were assessed during hospitalization and approximately one and five months post-trauma. Using latent class growth analysis, we estimated trajectories of several posttraumatic symptom dimensions: re-experiencing, avoidance, anxious arousal, numbing, dysphoric arousal, loss, and threat. We then examined sociodemographic and trauma-related characteristics (measured during hospitalization) as predictors of trajectory membership for each dimension.Four trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, Recovery) emerged for all dimensions except loss and threat, which manifested three trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset). Across dimensions, membership in the Chronic (vs. Resilient) trajectory was consistently predicted by unemployment (7 of 7 dimensions), followed by older age (3/7), female sex (3/7), and assaultive trauma (2/7). For several dimensions, unemployment also distinguished between participants who presented with similar symptom levels days after trauma, but then diverged over time.Measures of posttraumatic symptom dimension constructs differed across assessments.This study provides evidence of distinct trajectories across transdiagnostic symptom dimensions after traumatic injury. Employment status emerged as the most important predictor of trajectory membership. Research is needed to better understand the etiologies and consequences of these posttraumatic symptom dimension trajectories.",421

Brief screening instruments are needed for clinical and research purposes. We evaluated internal consistency, external construct, and criterion validity of the Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6; 6 items) compared to the original Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; 22 items) and to the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) reference standard evaluation in ARDS survivors.This study is a secondary analysis from two independent multi-site, prospective studies of ARDS survivors. Measures of internal consistency, and external construct and criterion validity were evaluated.A total of 1001 ARDS survivors (51% female, 76% white, mean (SD) age 49 (14) years) were evaluated. The IES-6 demonstrated internal consistency over multiple time points up to 5 years after ARDS (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86 to 0.91) and high correlation with the IES-R (0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 to 0.97). The IES-6 demonstrated stronger correlations with related constructs (e.g., anxiety and depression; |r| = 0.32 to 0.52) and weaker correlations with unrelated constructs (e.g., physical function and healthcare utilization measures (|r| = 0.02 to 0.27). Criterion validity evaluation with the CAPS diagnosis of PTSD in a subsample of 60 participants yielded an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI) of 0.93 (0.86, 1.00), with an IES-6 cutoff score of 1.75 yielding 0.88 sensitivity and 0.85 specificity.The IES-6 is reliable and valid for screening for PTSD in ARDS survivors and may be useful in clinical and research settings.",422

Although the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) has been used in India, no study has adapted the measure in full for use with this population. Similarly, the PTSD checklist-5 (PCL-5) has not yet been validated in India. This study describes the adaptation, validation, and results from the adapted HTQ, and embedded PCL-5, for Indian women from slums reporting GBV. Method This study used the adaptation framework proposed by the HTQ measure developers. The adapted HTQ contained a (1) trauma screen relevant for stressors faced by Indian women from slums, (2) description of the index trauma, (3) description of any ongoing stressors, (4) universal trauma reactions (i.e., PTSD measured by the PCL-5), and culturally relevant trauma reactions (i.e., idioms of distress measured by a scale developed for the study). This measure was piloted on 111 women from Indian slums in face-to-face interviews. Trauma characteristics, types of ongoing stressors, and psychometric properties of the PCL-5 and idioms of distress scale were explored. These scales were validated against measures of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and somatic complaints (PHQ-15). Results The majority of participants (77%) reported physical beatings, 18% reported unwanted sexual touch, and 28.8% reported infidelity as the primary emotional abuse. Further, 96.7% of GBV was perpetrated by partner or family member and over half reported ongoing stressors (e.g., poverty-related strain). The PCL-5 embedded in the HTQ yielded good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .88) as did the idioms of distress scale with deletion of one item (Cronbach’s alpha = .80). Both scales were externally valid, yielding large correlations with depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints ( r s between .54 and .80, p s &lt; .05). Discussion This is the first study to develop a comprehensive measure of trauma exposure with universal and culturally relevant trauma reactions in India. This study also enhances HTQ usage in India by delineating all the steps in the adaptation process. Results can inform the development of trauma-focused interventions for Indian women from slums.",423
https://openalex.org/W2777305498,10.1002/9781119462996.ch7,Evidence-Based Practice for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"This chapter briefly reviews the evidence for other posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) interventions so as to provide a comprehensive summary of treatment options for the disorder. The appropriate use of evidence-based practices, administered as soon as possible after return from deployment, may offer the best hope for alleviating PTSD and preventing subsequent occupational, social, and familial impairments. A number of etiological pathways and causal mechanisms have been implicated in the development of PTSD. PTSD is a severe psychiatric disorder resulting from a history of exposure to a traumatic event that results in a minimum threshold of symptoms across four symptom clusters namely: intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Additional criteria relate to duration of symptoms, functioning, and differential diagnosis due to a substance or other co-occurring condition.",424

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of adjustment disorder in the first 12 months after severe injury; to determine whether adjustment disorder was a less severe disorder compared with other disorders in terms of disability and quality of life; to investigate the trajectory of adjustment disorder; and to examine whether the subtypes described in DSM-5 are distinguishable.In a multisite, cohort study, injury patients were assessed during hospitalization and at 3 and 12 months postinjury (N=826). Structured clinical interviews were used to assess affective, anxiety, and substance use disorders, and self-report measures of disability, anxiety, depression, and quality of life were administered.The prevalence of adjustment disorder was 19% at 3 months and 16% at 12 months. Participants with adjustment disorder reported worse outcomes relative to those with no psychiatric diagnosis but better outcomes compared with those diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders. Participants with adjustment disorder at 3 months postinjury were significantly more likely to meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder at 12 months (odds ratio=2.67, 95% CI=1.59-4.49). Latent-profile analysis identified a three-class model that was based on symptom severity, not the subtypes identified by DSM-5.Recategorization of adjustment disorder into the trauma- and stressor-related disorders is supported by this study. However, further description of the phenomenology of the disorder is required.",425

The specific objective of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence of post-traumatic stress and depression on day 3 (D3) and week 6 (W6) following the 2018 flood in Kerala, India. In a cross-sectional study, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression were studied at D3 using primary care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder screen for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PC-PTSD-5), and then at W6 using PC-PTSD-5, Screening Questionnaire for Disaster Mental Health, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and Becks Depression Inventory. Majority (70 percent) were screen positive at D3 (n = 20) compared with 30 percent at W6 (n = 50), with a decreased frequency of all symptoms. Being PC-PTSD-5 screen positive at W6 was significantly associated with the presence of threat to life, physical injury, and death of relatives or neighbors. According to PCL-5, at W6, 46 percent had possible PTSD. Except damage to property, other disaster related or sociodemographic variables were not associated with the risk of having PTSD. Positive predictive value of PC-PTSD-5 (D3) for PTSD (PCL-5) at W6 was 64.3 percent. Depression and possibility of PTSD were significantly associated. A considerable proportion of victims continued to have post-traumatic stress and depression although the -frequency decreased over time.

While many clinicians who treat patients with these co-occurring conditions choose to avoid treatment targeting symptoms of PTSD for fear of de-stabilizing these individuals or exacerbating psychotic symptomatology, little is currently known about how patients respond to treatment for PTSD in the context of ongoing psychotic symptoms. Additionally, research is scarce regarding the clinical profile of individuals who develop psychotic symptoms secondary to a traumatic stressor, in the absence of any premorbid symptomatology. The purpose of this case report is to outline the case of an individual, “Mary” who developed psychotic symptoms secondary to a traumatic stressor in her middle age and to describe her response to treatment targeting her symptoms of PTSD. Mary presented with core symptoms of PTSD that emerged following a traumatic car crash. She developed psychotic symptoms (auditory and visual hallucinations) several weeks later. Mary underwent a treatment course of Prolonged Exposure targeting her symptoms of PTSD, with careful work done to monitor any changes in psychotic symptomatology while engaging in this treatment. Standardized measures such as the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5) and the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales were administered to assess Mary’s progress throughout treatment. This case report provides a comprehensive summary of Mary’s 16-week course of Prolonged Exposure therapy, which resulted in a significant reduction in PTSD symptomatology as demonstrated by a 72% decrease in scores on the PCL-5 from the initiation to the conclusion of treatment.",428

This is among the few studies worldwide, and the first in the South‐East Asian region, to prospectively evaluate PTSD in patients with cancer using gold‐standard clinical interviews. The objective of the study was to assess the course and predictors of PTSD in adult patients with cancer in a South‐East Asian population. METHODS A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted in a cohort of 469 consecutively recruited patients (aged ≥18 years) with various cancer types within 1 month of diagnosis at a single oncology referral center. Only patients who had significant psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total cutoff score ≥16) underwent the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (SCID) at at 6‐months follow‐up. All patients completed the SCID at the 4‐year follow‐up assessment regardless of their initial Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score. RESULTS In an analysis combining patients who had both full and subsyndromal PTSD, there was a 21.7% incidence of PTSD at the 6‐month follow‐up assessment (n = 44 of 203 SCID‐interviewed patients), with rates dropping to 6.1% at the 4‐year follow‐up assessment (n = 15 of 245 SCID‐interviewed patients). Patients with breast cancer (compared with those who had other types of cancer) were 3.68 times less likely to develop PTSD at 6‐months, but not at 4‐years follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS The overall rates of PTSD decreased with time, but one‐third of patients (34.1%) who were initially diagnosed had persistent or worsening PTSD 4 years later. There is a need for early identification of this subset of patients who have cancer with PTSD to design risk‐targeted interventions. Cancer 2018;124:406‐16 . © 2017 American Cancer Society .",429

However, SA-PTSD is rarely assessed in either clinical practice or research studies, due at least in part to a lack of research examining approaches to assessing SA-PTSD. This study examined the factor structure, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of scores on a version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) specifically anchored to one's own SA (PCL-5-SA).We recruited a sample of 386 SA survivors who completed the PCL-5-SA and related self-report measures.A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) that specified a 4-factor model consistent with the DSM-5 conceptualization of PTSD indicated that the PCL-5-SA had acceptable fit in our sample, χ²(161) = 758.03, RMSEA = 0.10, 90% CI =[0.09-0.11], CFI = 0.90, and SRMR = 0.06. The PCL-5-SA total and subfactor scores demonstrated good internal consistency (ωs = 0.88-0.95). Significant positive correlations of PCL-5-SA scores with anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns, expressive suppression, depression symptoms, and negative affect provided evidence for concurrent validity (rs = .25-.62).Results suggest that SA-PTSD, when measured with a specific version of the PCL-5, is a conceptually coherent construct that operates consistent with the DSM-5 conceptualization of PTSD stemming from other traumatic events.

In this study we attempted to investigate the association between traumatic events and borderline PD and the co-occurrence of complex PTSD, PTSD and borderline PD. Finally, we tested the association between complex PTSD and PTSD diagnoses and other DSM-5 Section II personality disorders. In a sample of 416 patients, we administered the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) to evaluate the PTSD/complex PTSD diagnoses and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders (SCID-5-PD) and the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire- 4+ (PDQ-4+) to assess borderline PD and other PDs. One hundred-twenty-three participants reported experiencing one or more traumatic events. Our findings show that the presence of adverse events does not represent a risk factor for borderline PD assessed using both SCID-5-PD and PDQ4+. A co-occurrence of borderline PD diagnoses and complex PTSD/PTSD diagnoses has not been observed. We found a significant association only between complex PTSD and schizoid personality disorder assessed using PDQ4+.

https://openalex.org/W2346744607,10.4088/jcp.15m09854,Prediction of Late-Onset Psychiatric Disorder in Survivors of Severe Injury,"Article Abstract Objective: There is a growing body of evidence indicating that late or delayed onset of psychiatric disorder following traumatic injury and other psychological trauma is common. This research, however, has not examined factors that pose risks for delayed development of different types of psychopathology or at different time points. Such research has considerable implications for the development of screening, assessment, and intervention practices. This article investigates risk factors for late-onset disorders up to 72 months after a severe injury. Methods: In this 6-year longitudinal study, 1,167 hospitalized patients with severe injury recruited between April 2004 and February 2006 were analyzed with repeated measures at 3, 12, and 72 months after injury. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were employed to complete diagnoses according to DSM-IV. Latent transition analyses with continuous covariates (injury severity, social support, recent life events, and pain) and 1 dichotomous covariate (presence/absence of a psychiatric disorder before injury) were conducted to identify risk factors for transitioning out of a No Disorder class and into one of 3 previously reported psychopathology classes (PTSD /Depression, Alcohol/Depression, and Alcohol only) between 3 and 12 months (transition 1) and between 12 and 72 months (transition 2) postinjury. Results: Movement into the PTSD/Depression class was predicted by injury severity at transitions 1 (P = .003) and 2 (P = .017) and social support (P = .006) at transition 1. Past psychiatric history increased the likelihood of moving into the PTSD/Depression class, with anxiety or mood disorders specifically implicated in transition 1. Movement into the Alcohol/Depression class was predicted by social support at transitions 1 (P = .008) and 2 (P < .001) and also by injury severity (P < .001) and pain (P < .001) at transition 2. Movement into the Alcohol class was predicted only by pain (P = .011) at transition 2. A history of a substance use or alcohol use disorder before injury was implicated in movement into both of the alcohol-based classes. Conclusions: Predictors of developing a delayed-onset psychiatric disorder after severe injury differed by duration after injury and class of disorder. These findings highlight the need to offer targeted screening based on these risk factors to severe injury survivors up to 12 months postinjury, even when they present without disorder at 3 months.",432

Management of PTSD is complicated because of the overlapping symptoms with the comorbid conditions and the diagnostic reliance on self‐report and time consuming psychological evaluation. A more comprehensive understanding of molecular pathophysiology of PTSD could facilitate an unbiased biomarker‐driven next‐generation intervention strategy. Herein, we study the epigenomic consequences of combat elicited PTSD in a longitudinal manner using blood methylation analysis. Methods Blood samples were collected pre‐deployment, immediately post‐deployment, and at a three month follow‐up. This study assessed participants prior to stressor exposure during the index deployment and included comprehensive whole blood analysis. We collected self‐reports such as PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5) along with clinical tests. DNA methylation assays were carried out using Illumina 450K , followed by repeated‐measures ANOVA, correlation analysis, and PTSD differential analysis to characterize methylation status alterations associated with significant PTSD Check List (PCL) changes (PCL difference &gt;10). Results We identified 64 subjects with changes in PCL scores of 10 across the three phases of the sample collection. The correlation analysis between DNA methylation and the PCL5 trend identified genes from T cell pathways, dopamine receptor signaling and fatty acid activation pathways. We observed shifts in DNA methylation that distinguish PTSD from controls and also that tracks PTSD as measured by PCL5. Conclusions We observed shifts in DNA methylation related to deployment related adverse health outcomes. Active Duty cohort represented a real‐world scenario measured stress before and a short time after combat‐related trauma. Future work will integrate these epigenetic data with other molecular and clinical findings to better understand PTSD co‐morbidities, as well as susceptibility and resiliency.

https://openalex.org/W3195833398,10.1037/tra0001084,Cross-lagged analyses of anger and PTSD symptoms among veterans in treatment.,"Anger is a salient feature of posttraumatic mental health which is linked to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and may have implications for treatment. However, the nature of associations involving anger and PTSD remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine bidirectional influences involving anger and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 PTSD symptom clusters over time among treatment-seeking veterans.Current or ex-serving members (n = 742; 92.4% male) who participated in an accredited outpatient PTSD treatment program were administered measures of PTSD symptoms (PTSD checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition [PCL-5]) and anger (Dimensions of Anger Reactions Scale-5 [DAR-5]) at treatment intake, discharge, and three-month follow-up. Bidirectional influences were assessed using cross-lagged panel analyses.The majority of participants (78%) exhibited significant anger problems at intake. Cross-lagged analyses showed anger was associated with relative increases in PTSD symptoms of intrusive reexperiencing and avoidance at posttreatment, whereas no reverse effects of any PTSD symptoms on anger were observed. Anger continued to influence changes in heightened sense of threat and avoidance symptoms at three-months posttreatment.Anger influences change in specific PTSD symptoms over time among military veterans in treatment and may interfere with treatments for PTSD. Veterans who present to clinical services with anger problems may benefit from anger interventions prior to commencing trauma-focused treatment. The findings have additional implications for conceptual models of the relationship between anger and PTSD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",434

However, the “equal weight” assumption fails to fit PTSD symptom data when tested. The present study developed an enhanced PTSD diagnosis based on (a) a conventional PTSD diagnosis from a clinical interview and (b) an empirical classification of full PTSD that reflected the relative clinical weights of each symptom. Method Baseline structured interview data from Project Harmony ( N = 2658) was used. An enhanced diagnosis for full PTSD was estimated using an empirical threshold from moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) latent PTSD scale scores, in combination with a full conventional PTSD diagnosis based on interview data. Results One in 4 patients in the sample had a PTSD diagnosis that was inconsistent with their empirical PTSD grouping, such that the enhanced diagnostic standard reduced the diagnostic discrepancy rate by 20%. Veterans, and in particular female Veterans, were at greatest odds for discrepancy between their underlying PTSD severity and DSM diagnosis. Conclusion Psychometric methodologies that differentially weight symptoms can complement DSM criteria and may serve as a platform for symptom prioritization for diagnoses in future editions of DSM.",435

This study aimed to develop and validate a scale to assess dysfunctional expectations in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the ""Posttraumatic Expectations Scale"" (PTES). In a cross-sectional study, 70 PTSD patients completed the PTES, the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), as well as measures of the severity of symptoms of PTSD and depression. The results show that the PTES has excellent internal consistency and correlates significantly with the PTCI and PTSD symptom severity. A regression analysis revealed that the PTES explained variance of PTSD symptom severity above the PTCI, supporting the incremental validity of the PTES. While the original version of the PTES comprises 81 items, short scales were constructed using the BISCUIT (best items scales that are cross-validated, unit-weighted, informative and transparent) method. The current findings provide preliminary psychometric evidence suggesting that the PTES is an internally consistent and valid novel self-report measure in patients with PTSD. However, conclusions about the psychometric properties of the PTES are limited because of the absence of criterion-related validity, factor structure evidence, variability over time/response to intervention, and test-retest reliability. Future research should use the PTES in large-scale longitudinal studies to address these aspects to further validate the scale.",436

Index tests included a parent report (a rationally derived scale from the Child Behavioral Checklist), a teacher report (the Teacher Report Form), and three youth reports-a PTSD scale from the Youth Self Report (YSR), Child PTSD Symptom Scale, and Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey. Interviews with the youth and caregiver using Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children generated criterion diagnoses of PTSD. Diagnoses were blind to scores on the index tests. Based on consensus diagnoses (N = 458), 10% of youth had PTSD. Area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristic analyses and multilevel likelihood ratios evaluated test performance. All youth reports (AUCs .67-.73) outperformed the teacher report (AUCs .42-.48) at identifying PTSD. The YSR outperformed the caregiver reports (AUCs .57-.58). Combining tests did not improve prediction of PTSD. The YSR predicted PTSD even after controlling for a self-reported traumatic event, but checklist ratings of traumatic events had no incremental value after controlling for YSR scores. When a youth endorsed few symptoms, the likelihood of the youth having PTSD was low. Very high scores on the YSR were associated with a moderate increase in the likelihood of PTSD diagnosis. The YSR appeared to be a useful diagnostic aid for youth PTSD and could facilitate differential diagnosis of youth PTSD in outpatient settings.",438

Understanding the factors that contribute to PTSD symptoms may lead to improved clinical management of PTSD and TBI. This study examines acute predictors of self-reported PTSD symptoms after TBI in military service members. Method Participants included 210 U.S. military service members (Age: M = 33.9 years, SD = 10.2) without injury (n = 86), or with history of uncomplicated mild TBI (n = 56), complicated mild, moderate, or severe TBI (n = 43), or bodily injury (n = 25) assessed at 0–8 months and ≥ 2 years post-injury. At both assessments, participants completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C), Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, Alcohol Use Disorder Checklist, Combat Exposure Scale, and TBI Quality of Life and passed symptom validity tests. Stepwise linear regression included 26 potential predictors (demographics, injury characteristics, military characteristics, and self-report measures at baseline) of PCL-C Total at follow-up. Results In this model, (F(4,188) = 68.0; p &amp;lt; .001; R2 = .591), baseline PCL-C (R2Δ = .52) was the main predictor of follow-up PCL-C Total, followed by Cognitive Concerns (R2Δ = .04), number of deployments (R2Δ = .01), and injury severity (R2Δ = .02). When baseline PCL-C was excluded as a predictor, somatosensory symptoms (R2Δ = .361), Emotional/Behavioral Dyscontrol (R2Δ = .067), Sleep (R2Δ = .033), Combat Exposure (R2Δ = .024), and Cognitive Concerns (R2Δ = .017) predicted follow-up PCL-C (F(5,187) = 37.7; p &amp;lt; .001; R2 = .502). Semipartial correlations revealed that most of the explained variance was shared among self-report predictors.

However, each patient experiences the impact of trauma differently exhibiting individual patterns of trauma symptoms. The current study endeavors to investigate individual patterns of trauma symptoms in military personnel and specifically analyze potential linkage and/or relation between blast exposure, anxiety, and depression.We employed a person-centered approach of latent class analysis (LCA) to stratify 594 military personnel outpatients based on their response patterns in the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI). Then, we related the resulting clusters to the number of blasts to which they were exposed, as well as to depression (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) and anxiety symptom severity (Beck Anxiety Inventory) using one-way analyses of variance with Bonferroni pairwise comparisons.We found three distinct clusters of traumatic symptoms: (a) Atypical response with low overall symptom burden, (b) increased response level and arousal, and (c) severe trauma symptom burden with tension-reduction behaviors. Individuals in Cluster 2 were exposed to significantly more blasts than in Cluster 1. Moreover, individuals in Cluster 3 reported the highest depression and anxiety symptom severities, followed by Cluster 2, followed by Cluster 1.These results suggest heterogeneity among military personnel suffering from trauma and reveal their distinct relations to clinical comorbidities-emphasizing the role of person-centered, tailored approaches in clinical practice.

Objective The current study tested the fit of seven models, including the 3-factor DSM-IV model (APA, 1994), the 4-factor DSM-5 model (APA, 2000), the 4-factor dysphoria model (Simms, Watson &amp; Doebbeling, 2002), the 5-factor dysphoric arousal model (Elhai et al., 2012), the 6-factor anhedonia model (Liu et al., 2014), the 6-factor externalizing behaviors model (Tsai et al., 2014) and the 7-factor hybrid model (Armour et al., 2015) that combines key features of the anhedonia and externalizing behaviors models. Aim It expected that the 7-factor hybrid model (Armour et al., 2015) would be the best fitting model. Methods PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Global Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (EGEP-5; Crespo, Gómez &amp; Soberón, 2016) in a sample of 165 victims of different traumatic events. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA s ) were conducted on each of the seven models using Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation method. Results All the models tested (except for DSM-IV model) yielded an adequate fit to the data. However, 7-factor hybrid model (Armour et al., 2015) provided a better fit than other competing models. Conclusions The current findings suggest that the dimensional structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms may be best represented by the 7 factors proposed in the hybrid model instead of 4 factors of DSM-5.

To this end, the current study examined the internal consistency of the PCL-5, convergent validity using correlations between the PCL-5 and another measure of PTSD, and discriminant validity using correlations between the PCL-5 and other commonly occurring psychiatric symptoms, including depression as well as alcohol and substance misuse.The sample was composed of 327 Black veterans (84% male, Mage = 51.87, SD = 13.72) presenting to a PTSD specialty clinic at a large Veterans Affairs hospital in the Midwest United States to receive psychological services. In addition to a diagnostic interview, veterans were asked to complete a brief battery of self-report questionnaires to assist with diagnostic clarification and treatment planning.The PCL-5 demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Furthermore, the PCL-5 was significantly and positively correlated with PTSD diagnostic status, suggesting evidence of convergent validity. Finally, the PCL-5 was strongly correlated with symptoms of depression and moderately correlated with alcohol and substance misuse.Findings suggest that the PCL-5 is a psychometrically sound measure to assess PTSD symptoms among Black veterans.

Most veterans do well, but a significant minority fare poorly. Adverse outcomes are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and also the development of minor but multiple health complaints, ‘multiple symptom illness’ (MSI). Aim This project investigates factors associated with both wellbeing and ill health in NZ veterans, with the aim of developing a parsimonious instrument to detect ‘at risk’ veterans prior to, or at, transition. Methods An on-line cross-sectional survey. Wellbeing is measured by the EQ-5D, a health-related quality of life instrument assessing mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The adverse outcome is PTSD, identified using the PCL-M, an instrument reflecting DSM-IV PTSD symptoms. Risk factors include MSI conforming to the Centers for Disease Control definition as ‘the presence, for at least six months, of one or more chronic symptoms from at least two of three categories, namely fatigue, mood-cognition and musculoskeletal symptoms’. The General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) screens for emotional distress and possible psychiatric morbidity. The Brief Trauma Questionnaire (BTQ), a 10-item self-report questionnaire derived from the Brief Trauma Interview, assesses the role of stressors contributing to PTSD. Protective factors include the 24-item Social Provisions Scale (SPS) assessing social relationships and various dimensions of social support. Analysis Logistic regression will identify the model of best fit for PTSD (PCL-M) and wellbeing (EQ-5D) respectively. For MSI, a factor analysis will describe the pattern of symptom reporting. If this matches international experience, 3 factors will explain the majority of the variance in the data. Results As at the 14th Nov 2018 we have 1592 completed questionnaires. Analysis will commence in mid-November 2018.",450

The aim of this pilot study was to examine the psychometric properties of the PCL-5 in parents of children with burns.The participating parents (N=62, mean age=38) completed self-report questionnaires, 0.8-5.6 years after their child's burn. Measures were the PCL-5, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Burn severity of the child and sociodemographic variables was obtained.The parents' average PCL-5 scores were low to moderate. The internal consistency of the PCL-5 was satisfactory, with Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.56 to 0.77 and mean inter-item correlations ranging from 0.22 to 0.73 for the four PCL-5 subscales and the PCL-5 total. The PCL-5 subscales were moderately to highly correlated with the corresponding IES-R subscales as well as MADRS and PSS (p<0.05), whereas associations with sociodemographics and burn severity were low to moderate.This study provides preliminary support for the use of PCL-5. The results indicate satisfactory psychometric properties of the PCL-5 as measured with internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and aspects of convergent validity.",451

Hospitalization can improve PTSD and AUD outcomes in some but not all patients, but we lack data on the baseline predictors of PTSD non-remission. This study aimed to determine the baseline risk factors for non-remitted PTSD in patients hospitalized for an AUD. Of 298 AUD inpatients recruited in a rehabilitation center (Le Courbat, France), we included 91 AUD inpatients with a co-occurring PTSD and a longitudinal assessment at baseline (T1) and before discharge (T2: 8 weeks later). Patients were assessed for PTSD diagnosis/severity (PCL-5=PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), different types of trauma including childhood trauma (LEC-5=Life Events Checklist for DSM-5/CTQ-SF=Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Short-Form), and AUD diagnosis/severity (clinical interview/AUDIT=Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). Rate of PTSD remission between T1 and T2 was 74.1%. Non-remitted PTSD at T2 was associated with a history of childhood trauma (physical, emotional or sexual abuse, physical negligence), but not with other types of trauma experienced, nor baseline PTSD or AUD severity. Among patients hospitalized for an AUD with co-occurring PTSD, PTSD remission was more strongly related to the existence of childhood trauma than to AUD or PTSD severity at admission. These patients should be systematically screened for childhood trauma in order to tailor evidence-based interventions.",452

Both groups were assessed at three time periods using self-report measures of PTSD symptomology. Findings from two cross-lagged panel analyses indicated weak temporal relationships between the symptom clusters of PTSD; however, avoidance and emotional numbing symptoms were found to exert the strongest cross-lagged effects. Avoidance and emotional numbing symptoms were also found to be the strongest predictor of subsequently meeting caseness for PTSD in both samples. Results suggest that there are minimal cross-lagged effects between the PTSD symptom clusters after three months from traumatic exposure.",453

With the advent of Diagnostic Statistic Manual-5 (DSM-5), there is an impending need to reexamine STS using DSM-5 symptoms in light of the most updated PTSD models in the literature. The study investigated and determined the best fitted PTSD models using DSM-5 PTSD criteria symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to examine model fit using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale in 241 registered and practicing Filipino nurses (166 females and 75 males) who worked in the Philippines and gave direct nursing services to patients. Based on multiple fit indices, the results showed the 7-factor hybrid model, comprising of intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing behavior, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal factors has excellent fit to STS. This model asserts that: (1) hyperarousal criterion needs to be divided into anxious and dysphoric arousal factors; (2) symptoms characterizing negative and positive affect need to be separated to two separate factors, and; (3) a new factor would categorize externalized, self-initiated impulse and control-deficit behaviors. Comparison of nested and non-nested models showed Hybrid model to have superior fit over other models. The specificity of the symptom structure of STS based on DSM-5 PTSD criteria suggests having more specific interventions addressing the more elaborate symptom-groupings that would alleviate the condition of nurses exposed to STS on a daily basis.",454
https://openalex.org/W2617781080,10.1002/jts.22185,Sometimes Less is More: Establishing the Core Symptoms of PTSD,"Historically, the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have garnered attention and controversy due to symptom overlap with other disorders. To improve diagnostic specificity, researchers have proposed to reformulate PTSD symptoms into a parsimonious set of core criteria. The core symptoms consisted of recurrent distressing dreams or flashbacks; internal or external avoidance; and hypervigilance or exaggerated startle. The purpose of this study was to examine a previously proposed set of “core” PTSD criteria in identifying cases of PTSD within a veteran sample. Veterans ( N = 383) presenting to a Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center PTSD clinic for psychological services were assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM‐5 (CAPS‐5). A logistic regression analysis revealed that the core criteria accurately identified 79% of veterans with PTSD ( OR = 11.57). Findings support a parsimonious set of core criteria in the assessment and diagnosis of PTSD. Future studies should replicate these findings in diverse, nonveteran samples.",455
https://openalex.org/W2966069284,10.1037/tra0000501,Measuring and conceptualizing PTSD following childbirth: Validation of the City Birth Trauma Scale.,"OBJECTIVE: City Birth Trauma Scale is a recently developed scale specifically designed for evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth based on the DSM-5 criteria (Ayers, Wright, & Thornton, 2018). Previous studies showed a two-factor structure of PTSD symptoms in postpartum women; however, more complex models were not tested. This study aimed to validate the Croatian version of the City Birth Trauma Scale and determine the latent factor structure of postpartum PTSD.

METHOD: In a cross-sectional study, 603 women completed online questionnaires comprising the City Birth Trauma Scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the anxiety subscale from the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21).

RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the bifactor model of birth-related symptoms and general symptoms had an excellent fit to the data. Both subscales and the total scale showed high internal consistency (α = .92). Convergent and divergent validity testing showed high validity, especially for birth-related symptoms. Discriminant validity was confirmed with primiparous women and women who gave birth by instrumental vaginal delivery and emergency caesarean section having significantly higher scores on birth-related symptoms, but not on general symptoms, suggesting high discriminant validity of the birth-related symptoms subscale.

CONCLUSIONS: The City Birth Trauma Scale is a reliable and valid measure. Both total scale score and subscale scores can be calculated. It is highly recommended for use in postpartum population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",456

We developed a Korean version of the original English scale through translation-back translation process and examined its reliability and validity among treatment-seeking adults at a psychiatric outpatient unit of a university-affiliated hospital in South Korea. The sample comprised adults diagnosed with PTSD (n = 100) and other psychiatric disorders (n = 134). The NSESSS-PTSD, the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were used to determine validity and reliability. The findings show modest test-retest reliability (r = .43), good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .81), high convergent validity (r = .78) with PCL-5 and good concurrent validity with the BDI (r = .55) and BAI (r = .50), respectively. A cut-off score of 16 best predicted PTSD from other psychiatric disorders with specificity of .90 and sensitivity of .87. This study reveals sound psychometric properties of the Korean version of the NSESSS-PTSD and supports its use in the clinical population.",457

We tracked PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed individuals in the United States and sought to identify population-based variability in PTSD symptom trajectories and understand what, if any, early pandemic experiences predicted membership in one trajectory versus others. As part of a longitudinal study of U.S. residents during the pandemic, participants who reported at least one potentially traumatic experience in their lifetime (N = 1,206) at Wave 1 (April 2020) were included in the current study. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PCL-5 at four time points extending to July 2021. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify heterogeneous symptom trajectories. Trajectory membership was regressed on experiences from the early stage of the pandemic as measured using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory in a model that controlled for variables with documented associations to PTSD trajectories, including age, sex, income, and trauma history. Four trajectories were identified, categorized as resilient (73.0%), recurring (13.3%), recovering (8.3%), and chronic (5.5%). Emotional and physical health problems and positive changes associated with the early phase of the pandemic were each significant predictors of trajectory membership over and above all other variables in the model. Predictors primarily differentiated the resilient trajectory from each of the other three trajectories. Distinct PTSD symptom trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a need for targeted efforts to help individuals at most risk for ongoing distress.",458

Participants (6 women and 2 men) were patients with PTSD related to CA who entered an 8 week treatment program with 16 twice-weekly ImRs sessions. Blind assessments took place at pre- and post-treatment and at 3 month follow-up. Participants showed improvement in both self-reported and clinician-rated PTSD symptoms. Gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. At post-treatment, 50% of participants no longer met criteria for PTSD, and this number increased to 75% at 3 month follow-up. The main limitation is the small sample size and the selective nature of the sample, which limits the generalizability of the findings. This pilot study suggests that Imagery Rescripting as stand-alone treatment is feasible and effective without prior stabilization in an outpatient population with CA-related PTSD. Further replication is needed in form of a randomized controlled trial.",459

Cross‐lagged regression models were estimated with 3 waves of longitudinal data to examine the reciprocal associations between PTSD symptom severity, as measured by the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and pain, as measured by a brief self‐report measure of pain called the PEG (pain intensity [P], interference with enjoyment of life [E], and interference with general activity [G]). We evaluated stress appraisals as a mediator of these associations in a sample of low‐income, underserved patients with PTSD ( N = 355) at federally qualified health centers in a northeastern metropolitan area. Increases in PTSD symptom severity between baseline and 6‐month and 6‐ and 12‐month assessments were independently predicted by higher levels of pain (β = .14 for both lags) and appraisals of life stress as uncontrollable (β = .15 for both lags). Stress appraisals, however, did not mediate these associations, and PTSD symptom severity did not predict change in pain. Thus, the results did not support the role of stress appraisals as a mechanism underlying the associations between pain and PTSD.",460

Methods: Trauma was defined based on DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition), SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) recommendation, and previous studies. A cross-sectional study using an online survey questionnaire was used to gather sociodemographics, trauma, and health information. Data were analyzed with SAS version 9.4 software using Chi-Square tests and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: The results of the survey indicated that 89.9% of the people surveyed had experienced traumas during their lifetime and 66.3% during childhood. Respondents who experienced more than 7 traumas were 7.9 times more likely to have potential risk of PTSD (OR: 7.877; 95% CI: 5.314-11.677), 2.3 times more likely to have depression (OR: 2.333; 95% CI: 1.446-3.763), and 3.5 times more likely to have a complex chronic disease (OR: 3.522; 95% CI: 2.261-5.485). A similar trend was found among respondents who experienced trauma in childhood (potential risk of PTSD OR=7.627; depression OR=3.508; complex chronic disease OR=2.979). Conclusion: These findings suggest that cumulative trauma is associated with both negative mental and physical health. Individuals may be exposed to various types of traumas during their lifetime. Interventions are necessary to promote resilience so that cumulative trauma does not threaten an individual’s health and life.",461

We conducted 3 hierarchical regression analyses adjusting for age, gender, sexual orientation, impulsivity, drug use, alcohol use, and gambling.The primary outcomes for this investigation were associations between posttraumatic stress symptoms, measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV and DSM-5 (PCL-C and PCL-5), and hypersexual behaviors, measured using the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory (HBI).A significant regression, R2 = 0.230, R2adjusted = 0.211, F (14,570) = 12.17, P < .001, revealed posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with hypersexual behaviors in the university student sample (β = 0.154). A significant regression using the MTurk sample, R2 = 0.403, R2adjusted = 0.392, F (14,771) = 37.13, P < .001, confirmed this finding (β = 0.259). In addition, a significant regression, R2 = 0.562, R2adjusted = 0.541, F (15,321) = 27.42, P < .001, indicated that posttraumatic stress symptoms were longitudinally associated with increased hypersexual behaviors (β = .190) after adjusting for all variables, including baseline hypersexuality.Results suggest that individuals experiencing posttraumatic stress symptoms are at increased risk for current and future hypersexual behaviors.This investigation involved secondary analyses of adults who had gambled at least once in their lives and findings may not generalize to those who have never gambled. Furthermore, longitudinal findings may be impacted by selection bias (42% completion rate) and may not generalize to follow up periods longer than 6-months.This study provides support for the hypothesis that posttraumatic stress symptoms are associated with increased hypersexual behavior, and further research is indicated to explore the etiology and directionality of this relationship.

https://openalex.org/W2619103907,,Identification of longitudinal patterns of positive psychological change in people following treatment for head and neck cancer,"Introduction
The experience of a traumatic or extremely stressful event may be sufficient to challenge a strongly held set of assumptions about the world and the self. In some people this may lead to the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or the increasingly recognised phenomenon of Positive Psychological Change (PPC) whereby a person’s reactions to the challenge are beneficial to one or more areas of their life.
Little work has been undertaken investigating the development and longitudinal pattern of PPC in cancer patients, and none with people who have had Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). The aims of the study were two fold; 1) to identify demographic, clinical and psychological factors associated with PPC which occur in the acute period, defined as 3-12 months after treatment, 2) to investigate, with the same factors, how PPC changed over time.
Method
The study adopted a realist paradigm using a non-interventionist approach, utilising data collected longitudinally. A literature review supported a quantitative approach to understanding the pattern of change in this field. To minimise response burden whilst maximising data collection and granularity, a cross-sequential methodology was used. An annual postal survey was undertaken over a five-year period. Each year all potential participants were sent the Silver Lining Questionnaire (SLQ; a measure of PPC), the University of Washington (UoW) HNC quality of life (QoL) measure, and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 12 (SF-12). Additional biographical and clinical data was collected for each individual from hospital databases.
Linear mixed-effects modelling was undertaken to investigate the relationships between the data that might describe or account for, the longitudinal nature of PPC. 
Results
Analysis indicated that the histological stage of the tumour and the treatment regime both have a relationship with the total score of the SLQ. The participants with lower stage tumours and those that only had surgical intervention reported more PPC. The multivariable model adjusting for psychosocial variables showed that the SLQ had a relationship with time since diagnosis, increasing initially after diagnosis and stabilising over time. The longitudinal data collected from the SLQ did not show any association when modelled with gender or family status, unlike previous research with women who had been treated for breast cancer. Greater levels of longitudinal PPC were reported by participants with high or low socio-economic status than those of middle socio-economic status, as measured by the Indices of Multiple Deprivation. Socio-economic status was not related to PPC in the first year following the completion of treatment.
The longitudinal model of PPC with the SLQ as the dependent variable found a relationship with the categories of chewing, speech and taste from the UoW. A greater level of PPC being present was associated with fewer problems with these three factors of HNC QoL. No association was found with the SF-12 or any of its sub-scales. When the data collected between 3 and 12 months, was compared with data collected longitudinally, stage of tumour, treatment regime, socio-economic status, and general health were all significantly associated with higher SLQ scores.
Discussion
The current research builds on the minimal prior PPC research undertaken with people who have had a diagnosis of HNC. In particular it demonstrates a model of trajectories for the development of PPC over a longitudinal period of time. 
Historically there has been concern that the reported PPC is actually illusory or a coping strategy rather than a real change. It is suggested that the pattern of PPC development should include this use of coping and be considered to have three distinct stages; the traumatic stressors, the coping and adaptive strategies in an acute phase, and the reforming of the assumptive world and stabilisation of new cognitions and behaviours.",463
https://openalex.org/W2947538986,10.1080/20008198.2019.1616488,Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) following captivity: a 24-year longitudinal study,"Background: The World Health Organization(WHO) International Classification of Diseases, 11th version (ICD-11), has proposed a new trauma-related diagnosis of complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), separate and distinct from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, to date, no study has examined CPTSD over time. Objectives: This prospective study aimed to examine predictors and outcomes of latent classes of PTSD and CPTSD following war captivity. Method: A sample of 183 Israeli former prisoners of the 1973 Yom Kippur War (ex-POWs) participated in a 24-year longitudinal study with three waves of measurements (T1: 1991, T2: 2008, and T3: 2015). Participants completed validated self-report measures, and their cognitive performance was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results: Estimated rates of PTSD and CPTSD were high at all waves, with PTSD rates higher than CPTSD. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified three main classes at T2: (1) a small class with low probability to meet PTSD and CPTSD clusters criteria (15.26%); (2) a class high only in PTSD symptoms (42.37%) and (3) a class high only in CPTSD symptoms (42.37%). Importantly, higher levels of psychological suffering in captivity at T1 were associated with higher odds of being in the CPTSD class at T2. In addition, CPTSD at T2 was more strongly associated with low self-rated health, functional impairment, and cognitive performance at T3, compared to the PTSD only class. Conclusions: Adulthood prolonged trauma of severe interpersonal intensity such as war captivity is related to CPTSD, years after the end of the war. Exposure to psychological suffering in captivity is a risk factor for future endorsement of CPTSD symptoms. CPTSD among ex-POWs is a marker for future dire mental health and functional consequences.Antecedentes: La Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), 11ª versión (CIE-11), ha propuesto un nuevo diagnóstico relacionado con el trauma del trastorno de estrés postraumático complejo (TEPTC), separado y distinto del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT). Sin embargo, hasta la fecha, ningún estudio ha examinado el TEPTC a lo largo del tiempo.Objetivos: Este estudio prospectivo tuvo como objetivo examinar los factores predictivos y los resultados de las clases latentes del TEPT y el TEPTC después del cautiverio de la guerra.Método: Una muestra de 183 prisioneros israelíes de la Guerra de Yom Kippur de 1973 (ex-prisioneros de guerra) participó en un estudio longitudinal de 24 años con tres momentos de mediciones (T1: 1991, T2: 2008, y T3: 2015). Los participantes completaron medidas validadas de autoinforme y su rendimiento cognitivo se evaluó mediante la Evaluación Cognitiva de Montreal (MoCA en sus siglas en inglés).Resultados: Las tasas estimadas del TEPT y TEPTC fueron altas en todos los momentos evaluados, con las tasas del TEPT más altas que del TEPTC. Un Análisis de Clase Latente (LCA en sus siglas en inglés) identificó tres clases principales en T2: (1) un grupo pequeño con baja probabilidad de cumplir con los criterios sintomáticos del TEPT y TEPTC (15.26%); (2) un grupo alto solo en los síntomas del TEPT (42.37%), y (3) un grupo alto solo en los síntomas del TEPTC (42.37%). Es importante destacar que los niveles más altos de sufrimiento psicológico en cautiverio en T1 se asociaron con mayores probabilidades de estar en el grupo del TEPTC en T2. Además, el TEPTC en T2 se asoció más fuertemente con una baja autoevaluación de salud, deterioro funcional, y rendimiento cognitivo en T3, en comparación con el grupo del TEPT solamente.Conclusiones: El trauma prolongado en la edad adulta de intensidad interpersonal severa, como el cautiverio de guerra, está relacionado con el TEPTC, años después de término de la guerra. La exposición al sufrimiento psicológico en cautiverio es un factor de riesgo para confirmación futura de los síntomas de TEPTC. El TEPTC entre los ex prisioneros de guerra es un marcador para la salud mental y las consecuencias funcionales futuras.背景：世界卫生组织（WHO）国际疾病分类第11版（ICD-11），提出了一种新的创伤相关的复杂性创伤后应激障碍（CPTSD）诊断，与创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）区分。然而，到目前为止，还没有研究对CPTSD进行追踪考察。目标：这项前瞻性研究旨在研究战争囚禁后PTSD和CPTSD潜在类别的预测因素和结果。方法：1973年赎罪日战争的183名以色列前囚犯（ex-POWs, 前战俘）参加了一项为期24年的纵向研究，其中有三次测量（T1：1991年，T2：2008年和T3：2015年）。参与者完成了自评问卷，并使用蒙特利尔认知评估工具（MoCA）评估了他们的认知表现。结果：在所有测量时间点PTSD和CPTSD的估计发病率都很高，PTSD高于CPTSD。潜类分析（LCA）确定了T2的三个主要类别：（1）符合PTSD和CPTSD症状簇标准的概率较低的小类（15.26％）; （2）仅有高PTSD症状（42.37％）和（3）仅有高CPTSD症状的大类（42.37％）。重要的是，在T1时被囚禁时更多的心理痛苦和出现在T2的CPTSD类别的更高的几率相关。此外，与PTSD类相比，T2的CPTSD类与T3的低自评健康、功能障碍和认知表现更强烈相关。结论：成年后长期严重的人际剧烈创伤，如战争囚禁，与战争结束数年后的CPTSD有关。囚禁过程中遭受心理痛苦是未来出现CPTSD症状的风险因素。前战俘中的CPTSD是以后的心理健康和功能恶化的提示。.",464

Thus, the present study assessed the correlates of symptoms that persisted at 4 months after an ED visit and, in particular, evaluated the associations between these symptoms and self-reported stress levels at ED admission and discharge.This study was a prospective observational investigation conducted in the ED of Bordeaux University Hospital that included patients admitted for minor trauma. All participants were contacted by phone 4 months after presentation at the ED to assess the occurrence of post-concussion-like symptoms (PCLS).A total of 193 patients completed the follow-up assessment at 4 months; 5.2% of the participants suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 24.5% suffered from PCLS. A multivariate analysis revealed an association between PCLS and stress level at discharge from the ED (odds ratios [OR]: 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–7.40).The risk of PCLS at 4 months after an ED visit for a minor injury increased in association with the level of stress at discharge from the ED. These results may improve the quality of life for the millions of patients who experience a stressful injury event every year.",465

Screening for PTSD is not routinely implemented in substance use treatment programs, despite clinical relevance. Identifying screening tools that minimize patient burden and allow for comprehensive treatment in this patient population is critical. The current study examined the utility of the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) in identifying probable PTSD in a predominantly Black sample of 81 socioeconomically disadvantaged substance misusing hospital patients. The majority of the sample (75.3 %; n = 61) were found to meet criteria for probable PTSD using a suggested clinical cut score of 33 on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Diagnostic utility analyses were completed and determined a cut-score of 5 for the PC-PTSD-5 to demonstrate the best performance (SE = 0.62, κ(1) = 0.22; SP =.80, κ(0) = 0.61; EEF = 0.67, κ(0.5) = 0.32) in this sample. Results provide preliminary support for the use of the PC-PTSD-5 as a brief screening tool for probable PTSD in substance misusing patient populations. Routine use of the PC-PTSD-5 during assessment may be beneficial when treatment planning with those undergoing treatment for SUD because comprehensive assessment and treatment will provide a better chance of long-term recovery.",466

The primary aim of this study was to provide an assessment of the reliability and validity of a newly developed self-report measure of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD: the ICD-11 Trauma Questionnaire (ICD-TQ). Participants in this study were a sample of individuals who were referred for psychological therapy to a National Health Service (NHS) trauma centre in Scotland (N=193). Participants completed the ICD-TQ and measures of traumatic life events, DSM-5 PTSD, emotion dysregulation, self-esteem, and interpersonal difficulties. Confirmatory factor analysis results supported the factorial validity of the ICD-TQ with results in line with ICD-11 proposals. The ICD-TQ demonstrated satisfactory internal reliability, and correlation results indicated that the scale exhibited convergent and discriminant validity. Current results provide initial support for the psychometric properties of this initial version of the ICD-TQ. Future theoretical and empirical work will be required to generate a final version of the ICD-TQ that will match the diagnostic structure of PTSD and CPTSD when ICD-11 is published.",467

However, self-reported peritraumatic dissociation is typically assessed months or years after trauma exposure and may be influenced by current distress levels and other factors. Method: We examined the temporal stability of scores on the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ) among 126 treatment-seeking adults with PTSD during and after trauma-focused treatment. Participants reported dissociation during the same index event at baseline and 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 weeks after the first treatment session. Results: There were substantial changes in PDEQ total scores over time, with > 40% of participants experiencing reliable change from baseline at least once during the study. Multilevel modeling revealed an overall decrease in PDEQ scores over time; scores on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 were each significantly associated with PDEQ scores. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the PDEQ does not provide temporally stable assessment of peritraumatic dissociation. Accordingly, it is crucial to control for current PTSD symptom levels when examining the degree to which peritraumatic dissociation confers risk for future symptom severity. Without such an accounting, our understanding of the relationship between PTSD and peritraumatic dissociation may be incorrect. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",468

Overt or unknown childhood traumas were also examined as a robust risk factor that might affect the development of PTSD in this population.METHODS: The sample of this study was composed of 100 female patients with a history of traumatic experiences and with a documented psychiatric diagnosis except PTSD who were admitted to Health Sciences University’s Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital Outpatient Clinic. Semi-structured sociodemographic data form, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Disorder Scale (CAPS) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28) were administered. Semi-structured sociodemographic form, were applied to the participants. Following clinical interviews and CAPS application, the patients were divided into two subgroups as patients with or without the diagnosis of current PTSD. Following screening of all variables for the accuracy of data entry, missing values, and homoscedasticity, statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS version 23 for Windows.RESULTS: The CTQ total scores (U = 233.000, z = −6.856, p = 0.000) and also Emotional Abuse (U = 235.000, z = −6.941, p = 0.000), Physical Abuse (U = 185.000, z = −7.424, p = 0.000), Emotional Neglect (U = 244.000, z = −6.851, p = 0.000), Physical Neglect (U = 208.000, z = −7.276, p = 0.000) and Sexual Abuse (U = 266.000, z = −7.554 p = 0.000) subscale scores were significantly higher in the PTSD present group. A statistically significant association was found between CAPS Total scores and Emotional Abuse (r = 0.870, p < 0.01), Physical Abuse (r = 0.879, p < 0.01), Emotional Neglect (r = 0.862, p < 0.01), Physical Neglect (r = 0.884, p < 0.01) and Sexual Abuse (r = 0.886, p < 0.01) subscale scores, and CTQ Total (r = 0.906, p < 0.01) scores. The regression analysis has indicated that CTQ Sexual Abuse scores were significant predictors of CAPS Total scores (p = 0.00) in patients with traumatic experiences when age was controlled.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the sociodemographic risk factors, traumatic experiences of childhood are important risk factors for PTSD. Man-made traumas such as rape, assault have a higher risk and symptom severity than natural disasters and traffic accidents for PTSD. Our results suggested a strong association between childhood sexual trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder.",469

This longitudinal study examined the prevalence, course and potential predictors of partners’ PTSD symptoms up to 18 months postburn.MethodsParticipants were 111 partners of adult burn survivors. In a multicenter study, PTSD symptoms were assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) during hospitalization of the burn survivor, and subsequently at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months postburn. Partners’ appraisal of threat to the burn survivor’s life, anger, guilt and level of rumination were assessed in the hospital as potential predictors of (long-term) PTSD symptoms in an exploratory piecewise latent growth model.ResultsAt the time of hospitalisation, 30% of the partners reported acute PTSD symptoms in the clinical range, which decreased to 4% at 18 months postburn. Higher acute PTSD symptoms were related to the presence of perceived life threat and higher levels of anger, guilt, and rumination. Over time, mean levels of PTSD symptoms decreased, especially in partners with high levels of acute PTSD symptoms, perceived life threat and rumination. From 3 months onward, PTSD symptoms decreased less in partners of more severely burned survivors. At 18 months postburn, higher levels of PTSD symptoms were related to more severe burn injuries and initial perception of life threat.ConclusionsOne in three partners of burn survivors reported clinical levels of acute PTSD symptoms shortly after the hospital admission, of which the majority recovered over time. This study showed that perceived life threat, feelings of anger and guilt, and rumination may indicate the presence of acute PTSD symptoms, whereas more severe burns and initial perception of life threat predict long-term PTSD symptom levels. The results highlight the need to offer psychological help to partners to alleviate acute elevated stress levels, which in turn may enhance the quality of support partners can provide to the burn survivor.",470

Early identification and treatment of these high-risk children can lead to improved mental health outcomes in this population. Objective: This study assesses the feasibility of a study protocol that compares 3 screening tools for identifying patients at a high risk of later development of acute stress disorder or PTSD among pediatric trauma patients. Methods: This pilot study compared 3 questionnaires used as screening tools for predictors of later development of PTSD in a convenience sample of pediatric trauma patients aged 7–17 years. Patients were randomized to one of 3 screening tools. Families were contacted at 30, 60, and 90–120 days postinjury to complete the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms questionnaire. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the screening tools were compared for the diagnosis of PTSD defined using the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms questionnaire. Results: Of the 263 patients identified for possible enrollment, 52 patients met full inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. Only 29 (55.7%) patients completed at least one follow-up questionnaire. The prevalence of acute stress disorder and PTSD in our population was 41% (95% CI [24, 61]) and 31% (95% CI [15, 51]), respectively. Conclusions: In this pilot study, we sought to determine the utility of the 3 commonly used screening instruments for measuring traumatic stress symptoms in pediatric trauma patients to predict the diagnosis of acute stress disorder or PTSD. Limitations include the use of the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms screening tool as the gold standard for calculating test characteristics and lack of 24/7 enrollment capabilities. As such, a significant portion of patients were discharged prior to our teams' engagement for enrollment.",471

However, posttraumatic stress-related symptoms (hereafter as PTSD symptoms) and their precipitating factors were seldom examined among bereaved family members and primarily focused on associations between PTSD symptoms and patient/family characteristics. We aimed to investigate the course and predictors of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members of deceased ICU patients by focusing on modifiable quality indicators for end-of-life ICU care.In this longitudinal observational study, 319 family members of deceased ICU patients were consecutively recruited from medical ICUs from two Taiwanese medical centers. PTSD symptoms were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 13 months post-loss using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Family satisfaction with end-of-life care in ICUs was assessed at 1 month post-loss. End-of-life care received in ICUs was documented over the patient's ICU stay. Predictors for developing clinically significant PTSD symptoms (IES-R score ≥ 33) were identified by multivariate logistic regression with generalized estimating equation modeling.The prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms decreased significantly over time (from 11.0% at 1 month to 1.6% at 13 months post-loss). Longer ICU stays (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.036 [1.006, 1.066]), financial insufficiency (3.166 [1.159, 8.647]), and reported use of pain medications (3.408 [1.230, 9.441]) by family members were associated with a higher likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members during bereavement. Stronger perceived social support (0.937 [0.911, 0.965]) and having a Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) order issued before the patient's death (0.073 [0.011, 0.490]) were associated with a lower likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms. No significant association was observed for family members' satisfaction with end-of-life care (0.988 [0.944, 1.034]) or decision-making in ICUs (0.980 [0.944, 1.018]).The likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members decreased significantly over the first bereavement year and was lower when a DNR order was issued before death. Enhancing social support and facilitating a DNR order may reduce the trauma of ICU death of a beloved for family members at risk for developing clinically significant PTSD symptoms.",472

It is not known if total white blood cell (WBC) count, a routinely checked inflammatory marker, is associated with PTSD symptom trajectories using medical record data.We used latent class growth analysis to identify three-year PTSD symptom trajectories using PTSD Checklist (PCL) scores. The outcome for each patient was maximum WBC count from index PTSD diagnosis to last PCL. Using linear regression analysis, we then calculated and compared the average WBC count for each trajectory before and after controlling for age, gender, race, obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, depression and other co-morbid inflammatory conditions.Patients were 40.2 (SD±13.5) years of age, 83.7% male and 67.9% white. We identified three PCL trajectory groups based on symptom severity over time: 'moderate-large decrease', 'moderate severe-slight decrease', and 'severe-persistent'. In adjusted analyses, 'severe-persistent' vs. 'moderate-large decrease' had significantly higher WBC count (B=0.64; 95%CI=0.18, 1.09; p=.006). Although non-significant, 'moderate severe-slight decrease' vs. 'moderate-large decrease' also had a higher WBC count (B=0.42; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.86; p=.061).Persistently severe PTSD is associated with a higher WBC count than improving PTSD. WBC appears to have utility for measuring the association between psychiatric disorders and inflammation in retrospective cohort studies involving large administrative medical record data bases.",473

As part of an ongoing research project, this study examined the safety and effectiveness of intensive eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in a group of seven (four female) patients suffering from complex PTSD and multiple comorbidities resulting from childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and/or work and combat-related trauma. Treatment was not preceded by a preparation phase and consisted of 2 × 4 consecutive days of EMDR therapy administered in morning and afternoon sessions of 90 minutes each, interspersed with intensive physical activity and psychoeducation. Outcome measures were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Symptom Scale Self-report questionnaire (PSS-SR). During treatment, neither personal adverse events nor dropout occurred. CAPS scores decreased significantly from pre- to posttreatment, and four of the seven patients lost their PTSD diagnosis as established with the CAPS. The results were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d ) on the CAPS and PSS-SR were large: 3.2, 1.7 (prepost) and 2.3, 2.1 (prefollow-up), respectively. The results of this case series suggest that an intensive program using EMDR therapy is a potentially safe and effective treatment alternative for complex PTSD. The application of massed, consecutive days of treatments using EMDR therapy for patients suffering from PTSD, particularly those with multiple comorbidities, merits more clinical and research attention.",474

Although psychometrically sound measures are now available to assess these youths, brief tools are currently needed for screening purposes. Two studies were conducted to develop and validate the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-5–Brief Form (RI-5-BF). Method Study 1 used item response theory models to derive the RI-5-BF from the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-5 and assess its internal consistency using a sample of 486 trauma-exposed youths (mean age = 13.32 years, SD = 2.90) recruited through a practice research network. Study 2 used receiver operating characteristic analyses and diagnostic efficiency statistics to assess the discriminant-groups validity and clinical utility of the RI-5-BF in identifying children at different levels of PTSD risk using a sample of 41 treatment-seeking youths (mean age = 12.44 years, SD = 2.99). Results In study 1, item response theory models identified the 11 most informative items across their respective subscales. The RI-5-BF exhibited excellent internal consistency in both studies (α > .93). In study 2, receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated that an RI-5-BF score of 21 maximized sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, diagnostic likelihood ratios across multiple levels of scores provided support for the measure’s clinical utility in identifying different levels of PTSD risk. Conclusion These findings provide support for both the psychometric properties of the RI-5-BF as a brief screening measure for PTSD in children and adolescents and its utility for identifying youths meriting further assessment and consideration for treatment.

Most of them experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and post-traumatic growth (PTG). There are limited studies to assessing the correlation between these two psychological outcomes among CPR survivors. Objective This study aimed to examine the correlation between PTSD and PTG among CPR survivors in South-East Iran. Subjects Using Quota sampling, 163 CPR survivors in two provinces in the South-East of Iran were selected to participate in this study. Method A descriptive-correlational study was used to fulfill the aim of the study. The impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for assessing PTSD and Post-traumatic growth questionnaires were used to assess PTG. Results The mean score of PTSD was 39.89 and according to the cutoff point, 87.1% of participants suffered from PTSD. The mean score of PTG was 78.6. PTSD and PTG had significant negative correlation. The result of multi-variate logistic regression showed that only the PTG score predicted PTSD (Odds ratio = 0.79, CI = 0.72–0.87; and p &lt; 0.001). The result of multi-variate linear regression indicated that PTSD, time passed since CPR, and physical disability caused by CPR predicted PTG score significantly. Conclusion This study provides CPR survivors and health care personnel with some valuable insights about cultural aspects of PTSD and PTG among CPR survivors and that PTG is positively influenced by physical disability and time passed since CPR. CPR survivors may gain positive experience and valuable insight in group meetings and discussions with their counterparts.",476

According to the Texas Cancer Registry (TCR) an estimated 18,277 of those new diagnoses of female breast cancer will be made in the state of Texas. Studies have found that between 5% and 35% of breast cancer patients in the United States will develop diagnosable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or significantly impairing PTSD symptoms. The goal of the study was to gather data related to the presence of PTSD symptoms in a sample of West Texas female breast cancer patients. The proposed study aimed to:. (1)Determine the prevalence of PTSD in a sample of female, West Texas breast cancer patients(2)Identify elements of a breast cancer diagnosis and breast cancer treatment that may contribute to, or exacerbate these PTSD symptoms. Our sample consistent of 78 female breast cancer patients collected from a university medical center-affiliated cancer center in the West Texas region. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL5) was used to determine if a participant met diagnostic criteria for PTSD or fulfilled diagnostic criteria for any of the four symptom clusters – intrusive symptoms, avoidance symptoms, negative symptoms, and hyperarousal symptoms. PCL5 scores were then compared to a range of demographic variables including age, marital status, educational level, menopausal status, tobacco and alcohol use, time since diagnosis, as well as treatment modalities used. Further, PCL5 scores were compared to Her2, ER, and PR status of the tumor as well as clinical stage. Patients meeting criteria for PTSD and those with significant symptoms in distinct symptom clusters The only multi-group categorical variable that showed a significant relationship was lifetime tobacco use (F(2,75) = 4.97, p = 0.009) which showed a relationship such that current smokers were found to have higher PCL5 scores that either participants that were past smokers or those that had never smoked. Further, menopausal status (pre-menopausal versus post-menopausal) did was found to be related to PCL5 scores such that pre-menopausal women were found to have significantly higher PCL5 scores than post-menopausal women (t(71) = 2.558, p = 0.42). Living arrangement (alone or with others) was similarly, significantly related to PCL5 scores such that women living with others were found to have higher PCL5 scores than those living alone (t(74) = -1.904, p = .002). Receiving chemotherapy treatment or not was similarly related to PCL5 scores such that those that underwent chemotherapy treatment were found to have higher PCL5 scores (t(76), = -2.381, p = .008). HER2 positive status was also found to be related to PCL5 scores, such that HER2 positive patients were found to have higher PCL5 scores than HER2 negative patients (t(74) = -2.429, p = .001). While other samples identified larger percentages of diagnosable PTSD, our sample did find a percentage of patients with diagnosable PTSD consistent with the lower end of estimated rates. This. suggests that our sample is similar in some ways to that used in the existing body of literature. Future research could expand the scope of this study by including focusing on the significant variables identified in the current study, as well as by including more factors that may be particularly relevant to the patient population of the West Texas region, such as measures of religiosity, individualism, or self-reliance. nPercentage of total sampleNo significant symptoms4962.82%Significant symptoms in one symptom cluster1316.66%Significant symptoms in two symptom clusters67.69%Significant symptoms in three symptoms clusters33.85%Significant symptoms in all four symptom clusters (met criteria for PTSD diagnosis)78.97%Total78100% Citation Format: Evan Thomas Guidry, Nusrat Jahan, Catherine Jones.

https://openalex.org/W3016825665,10.1037/tra0000564,Symptoms improve after a yoga program designed for PTSD in a randomized controlled trial with veterans and civilians.,"OBJECTIVE Although yoga shows promise as a treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there are few randomized controlled trials that demonstrate significant benefits for individuals with PTSD. The present study addresses this need by comparing the effects of a holistic yoga program (HYP) to that of a wellness lifestyle program (WLP) on PTSD symptom severity with a randomized clinical trial. METHOD The sample consisted of 209 participants (91.4% veterans; 66% male; 61.7% White) who met diagnostic criteria for PTSD at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to attend one of the 2 weekly interventions for 16 weeks. The HYP consisted of yoga instruction, while the WLP consisted of didactics, discussions, and walking. PTSD severity was measured using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) and the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5). RESULTS Analyses revealed that the HYP reduced PTSD severity measured by the CAPS-5 significantly more than the WLP at treatment end (mean difference = -5.4, effect size = 0.46, p < .001), but not at 7-month follow up (mean difference = -0.9, p = .603). Similarly, the HYP reduced PTSD severity measured by the PCL-5 significantly more than the WLP at treatment end (difference = -6.0, p = .001), but not at 7-month follow up (mean difference = -1.0, p = .682). CONCLUSION Yoga may be an effective intervention for PTSD in addition to standard treatments. Future yoga trials should consider adding a social component to interventions or booster classes to maintain effects long term. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",478

Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) may also impact this population but has been seldom studied. Aims The present study investigated the rate of both PTSD and PGD among clients receiving community mental health services, and the clinical correlates of co-occurring PTSD/PGD. Methods Trauma history, PTSD and PGD were assessed among 536 individuals receiving community mental health services (Study 1). A subsample of 127 individuals from Study 1 who met DSM-5 criteria for PTSD based on diagnostic interview completed measures of psychiatric symptoms (Study 2). Results In Study 1, 92.4% of participants receiving community mental health services had experienced a traumatic event, 49.6% met criteria for probable and provisional PTSD, 14.7% scored positive for probable PGD, and 11.9% met criteria for probable and provisional PTSD as well as probable PGD. In Study 2, participants meeting diagnostic DSM-5 criteria for PTSD and probable PGD had more self-reported PTSD symptoms, but did not differ on other outcomes. Conclusions Findings highlight the need for trauma informed services including grief counseling for persons with SMI.",479

https://openalex.org/W2781491189,10.1016/j.ajog.2017.10.134,157: Severe postpartum hemorrhage causes posttraumatic disorder in women,"During childbirth, severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a serious complication. Incidence rates of PPH in developed countries increase. In addition to maternal mortality and morbidity, PPH causes psychological and emotional distress. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma- and stressor related disorder someone may develop in response to experiencing a traumatic event like PPH. The disorder can be diagnosed accurately and can be treated. There is little published data on the correlation between severe PPH and PTSD. Our aim was to assess whether severe PPH is a risk factor for developing PTSD. From April 2015 until June 2017 we conducted a prospective cohort study comparing two groups: patients with PPH of ≥2 liters and a control group that had blood loss of <0,5 liter. We used the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Clinical Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) to assess PTSD symptoms and diagnosis respectively. Demographic data was collected from the hospital records. We included 197 patients (age 32,7 ± 4,2 yrs (mean±SD); with blood loss 2500 ± 2000-3000 mL (Mdn±IQR)) and 122 controls (age 32,5 ± 4,2 yrs; blood loss 300 ± 200-400 mL). At around eight weeks postpartum, based on a PCL-5 score of ≥ 32, there is no significant difference between complaints in the two groups (6,7% vs 1,6%; p=,084, Pearson Chi-Square test). According to diagnosis (CAPS-5), there is a significant difference (5,1 vs 0%); p=,008 between patients and controls. Regression analysis did not show a significant difference in this small sample. In this study, according to the gold standard for diagnosis of PTSD, there is a relationship between PTSD and severe PPH. PPH patients have to be screened for PTSD by intensive follow-up or screeners.",481

The onset and persistence of PTSD can be attributed to advanced age. This study aimed to explore the occurrence and influencing factors of enduring post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in survivors aged 60 years and over in the main area of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake 10 years after the disaster. Methods Data were collected using a multistage sampling method from individuals aged 60 years and older living in the main impacted areas of Wenchuan 10 years after the Wenchuan earthquake. The PTSD Checklist‐Civilian Version (PCL‐C) was used to evaluate PTSD symptoms. We evaluated participants based on their PTSD symptoms: those exhibiting and those without. The latter group was four times the size of the former and was matched based on gender and age (within ± 2 years). Conditional logistic regression was used to discern the risk factors. Results Out of the total, 56 participants were recognized as having probable PTSD as per the PCL‐C checklist, leading to a rate of 9.4% (56/588). The univariate conditional logistic regression values showed that playing Mahjong/poker (odds ratio (OR) = 0.394, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.171–0.911) and displacement (OR = 0.446, 95% CI = 0.220–0.907) were protective factors for the long‐term mental health of survivors in the hard‐hit areas, while the presence of a 2‐week illness (OR = 3.605, 95% CI = 1.751–7.424), possessing insurance (OR = 0.250, 95% CI = 0.072–0.864), suffering from a chronic ailment (OR = 3.132, 95% CI = 1.2–8.174), and having an injured family member (OR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.136–4.496) emerged as risk factors for PTSD symptoms. Multivariate analysis indicated that the absence of insurance and prevalence of 2‐week illness correlated with increased PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Ten years after the Wenchuan earthquake, the prevalence of probable PTSD remained significantly high in the elderly population. The major risk factors were the absence of insurance and the occurrence of a 2‐week illness. Policymakers should incorporate these findings when devising strategies for aging societies.",482

This increased signaling may result from increased norepinephrine (NE) release, from altered brain responses to NE, or from a combination of both factors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Veterans reporting a history of trauma exposure would show an increased association between brain NE and mental health symptoms commonly observed after trauma, as compared to Veterans who did not report a history of trauma exposure, consistent with the possibility of increased brain reactivity to NE after traumatic stress.Using a convenience sample of 69 male Veterans with a history of combat-theater deployment, we examined the relationship between trauma-related mental health symptoms and the concentration of NE in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF NE levels were measured by HPLC in CSF from morning lumbar puncture. Behavioral symptoms associated with diagnoses of PTSD, depression, insomnia, or post-concussive syndrome (PCS), which together cover a wide variety of symptoms associated with alterations in arousal systems, such as sleep, mood, concentration, and anxiety, were assessed via self-report (PTSD Checklist [PCL] for PTSD, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ9] for depression, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] for sleep problems including insomnia, and Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory [NSI] for PCS) and structured clinical interview (Clinician-Administered PSTD Scale [CAPS]). Individuals meeting criterion A of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD were considered trauma-exposed. Linear regression models were used to quantify the association between CSF NE and symptom intensity in participants with and without a history of trauma exposure, as well as in participants with a history of trauma exposure who were currently taking the noradrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin.Fifty-two Veterans met criteria for a history of trauma exposure; of these, 36 met criteria for PTSD. CSF NE levels were not significantly different in Veterans with a history of trauma compared to those without, nor in Veterans with PTSD as compared to those without. Veterans with a history of trauma and who were not using the medication prazosin demonstrated a significantly more positive correlation between CSF NE and behavioral symptom expression than Veterans who had not experienced traumatic stress. No relationship between CSF NE and behavioral symptom expression was found in Veterans who had experienced traumatic stress and were taking prazosin at the time of the assessments.These results are consistent with increased central nervous system responsiveness to noradrenergic signaling in individuals with a history of traumatic exposure, raising the possibility that there may be long-lasting physiologic effects of trauma-exposure that exist independently of whether an individual meets criteria for PTSD at any given point in time. Exploration of the mechanism by which brain responsiveness to NE is modulated following trauma holds the possibility of finding new strategies for both preventing and treating PTSD.",483

The National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study (NVVLS) is a congressionally mandated assessment of Vietnam veterans who underwent previous assessment in the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS).To determine the prevalence, course, and comorbidities of war-zone posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across a 25-year interval.The NVVLS survey consisted of a self-report health questionnaire (n = 1409), a computer-assisted telephone survey health interview (n = 1279), and a telephone clinical interview (n = 400) in a representative national sample of veterans who served in the Vietnam theater of operations (theater veterans) from July 3, 2012, through May 17, 2013. Of 2348 NVVRS participants, 1920 were alive at the outset of the NVVLS, and 81 died during recruitment; 1450 of the remaining 1839 (78.8%) participated in at least 1 NVVLS study phase. Data analysis was performed from May 18, 2013, through January 9, 2015, with further analyses continued through April 13, 2015.Study instruments included the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD, PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV supplemented with PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 items (PCL-5+), Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Nonpatient Version.Among male theater veterans, we estimated a prevalence (95% CI) of 4.5% (1.7%-7.3%) based on CAPS-5 criteria for a current PTSD diagnosis; 10.8% (6.5%-15.1%) based on CAPS-5 full plus subthreshold PTSD; and 11.2% (8.3%-14.2%) based on PCL-5+ criteria for current war-zone PTSD. Among female veterans, estimates were 6.1% (1.8%-10.3%), 8.7% (3.8%-13.6%), and 6.6% (3.5%-9.6%), respectively. The PCL-5+ prevalence (95% CI) of current non-war-zone PTSD was 4.6% (2.6%-6.6%) in male and 5.1% (2.3%-8.0%) in female theater veterans. Comorbid major depression occurred in 36.7% (95% CI, 6.2%-67.2%) of veterans with current war-zone PTSD. With regard to the course of PTSD, 16.0% of theater veterans reported an increase and 7.6% reported a decrease of greater than 20 points in Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD symptoms. The prevalence (95% CI) of current PCL-5+-derived PTSD in study respondents was 1.2% (0.0%-3.0%) for male and 3.9% (0.0%-8.1%) for female Vietnam veterans.Approximately 271,000 Vietnam theater veterans have current full PTSD plus subthreshold war-zone PTSD, one-third of whom have current major depressive disorder, 40 or more years after the war. These findings underscore the need for mental health services for many decades for veterans with PTSD symptoms.",484

Methods Out of 10,502 who responded, 9,274 students impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were included in our study. PTSD symptoms was evaluated by the Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). Anxiety/depression symptoms were evaluated by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Personality traits, coping style, and social support were assessed by the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Short Scale for Chinese (EPQ-RSC), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). Logistic regression analysis was utilized to further explore risk factors for PTSD symptoms. Results More than 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak, 13.1% of college students developed PTSD symptoms, indicating that COVID-19 associated stressful experiences were connected with PTSD symptoms. After the COVID-19 outbreak, subjects with symptomatologic PTSD symptoms were more likely to experience strained relationships with their family, to have close contact with COVID-19 patients and to drop out of college. The logistic regression model demonstrated the association factors of PTSD symptoms. Neuroticism, psychoticism and an avoidant coping style were associated with increased risk for PTSD symptoms, while an active coping style was protective against PTSD symptoms during this pandemic. Conclusion The results showed that PTSD symptoms was prevalent in Chinese college students 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak. Effective psychological support work should be carried out accordingly.",485

This study assessed associations between ACEs at different ages to thalamic volumes and PTSD development following acute adult trauma. Methods Seventy-nine adult trauma survivors were recruited immediately after trauma. Within 2 weeks of the traumatic event, participants completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL) to assess PTSD symptoms, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and Childhood Age Range Stress Scale (CARSS) to evaluate ACEs and perceived stress level at preschool (&amp;lt;6 years old) and school (6–13 years old) ages, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to measure thalamic volumes. Participants were divided into three groups: those who experienced no childhood trauma or stress (non-ACEs), those who experienced childhood trauma and stress onset at preschool ages (Presch-ACEs), and those who experienced childhood trauma and stress onset at school ages (Sch-ACEs). At 3 months, participants underwent PTSD symptom evaluation using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Results Adult trauma survivors in the Presch-ACEs group had higher CTQ and CAPS scores. In addition, survivors in the Presch-ACEs group had smaller thalamic volume compared to survivors in the non-ACEs and Sch-ACEs groups. Furthermore, smaller thalamic volume moderated a positive association between post-trauma 2-week PCL and subsequent 3-month CAPS scores. Discussion Earlier occurrence of ACEs was associated with smaller thalamic volume, which appears to moderate a positive association between early posttraumatic stress symptom severity and PTSD development after adult trauma. This raises the possibility that early occurrence of ACEs may impact thalamic structure, specifically a reduction in thalamic volume, and that smaller thalamic volume may contribute to susceptibility to PTSD development after adult trauma.",486

Although the IES-R has been translated and validated in multiple languages, no previous version has employed the Arabic dialect commonly spoken in Syria. The present work aimed to assess the psychometric properties of a Syrian Arabic version of the IES-R. Syrian citizens (N = 288) living in refugee camps in Turkey were administered the Syrian Arabic IES-R as part of a humanitarian aid project focused on providing psychological assistance. The data were analyzed with respect to 10 previously published factor solutions. We found that the best-fitting model was a four-factor structure that included factors involving Avoidance-Numbing, Intrusion, Hyperarousal, and Sleep Disturbance. The model showed strong measurement invariance between male and female subsamples, allowing for meaningful comparisons of the factor means. Overall, the present findings support the validity of a new version of the IES-R, which can be used by both researchers and clinicians responding to the urgent need for psychological care for Syrian refugees fleeing war-related violence.",487

The present study examined the relationships between sleep continuity and architecture on PTSD symptom clusters. Methods Participants underwent two in-laboratory sleep studies to assess sleep continuity and architecture. They also completed the Clinician-Administered PTSD-IV scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV to assess for PTSD diagnosis and other psychiatric disorders. Results Sleep continuity (i.e. total sleep time, sleep efficiency percent, wake after sleep onset, sleep latency) was significantly related to PTSD Cluster B (reexperiencing) symptom severity (R2 = .27, p &amp;lt; .001). Sleep architecture, specifically Stage N1 sleep, was significantly associated with PTSD Cluster B (t = 2.98, p = .004), C (Avoidance; t = 3.11, p = .003), and D (Hyperarosual; t = 3.79, p &amp;lt; .001) symptom severity independently of Stages N2, N3, and REM sleep. REM sleep variables (i.e. REM latency, number of REM periods) significantly predicted Cluster D symptoms (R2 = .17, p = .002). Conclusions These data provide evidence for a relationship between objective sleep and PTSD clusters, showing that processes active during Stage N1 sleep may contribute to PTSD symptomatology in civilians and veterans. Further, these data suggest that arousal mechanisms active during REM sleep may also contribute to PTSD hyperarousal symptoms.

Methods Participants in this study responded to Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the Philippines in November 2013. They completed the Psychological Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (PsySTART) responder triage tool, the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) shortly after responding to this disaster. The relationships between these 3 tools were compared to determine the association between different risk exposures while providing disaster medical care and subsequent levels of PTSD or depression. Results The total number of PsySTART responder risk factors was closely related to PCL-5 scores ≥38, the threshold for clinical PTSD. Several of the PsySTART risk factors were predictive of clinical levels of PTSD as measured by the PCL-5 in this sample of deployed emergency medical responders. Conclusions The presence of a critical number and type of PsySTART responder self-triage risk factors predicted clinical levels of PTSD and subclinical depression in this sample of emergency medical workers. The ability to identify these disorders early can help categorize an at-risk subset for further timely “stepped care” interventions with the goals of both mitigating the long-term consequences and maximizing the return to resilience.

Our aim was to measure the prevalence of PTSD among Chinese healthcare workers exposed to physical violence‚ and explore the associations of their demographic characteristics, social support, personality traits‚ and coping styles with their PTSD symptoms. <h3>Methods</h3> A cross-sectional study was conducted using the Workplace Violence Scale, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Short Scale and Trait Coping Style Questionnaire. We used convenience sampling method to collect data from March 2015 to September 2016. Healthcare workers (n=2706) from 39 public hospitals located in Heilongjiang, Hebei and Beijing provinces of China completed the questionnaires (effective response rate=84.25%). <h3>Results</h3> Overall, the prevalence of physical violence in the previous 12 months was 13.60% (n=2706). The prevalence of PTSD among the healthcare workers who experienced physical violence was 28.0% (n=368). Most of the victims of physical violence (50.80%) did not exhibit PTSD symptoms based on their PCL-C scores, and 47.0% did not manifest the diagnostic criteria for PTSD after experiencing physical violence. The level of PTSD symptoms was negatively correlated with their scores on the SSRS (r=−0.188, p&lt;0.001). The hierarchical regression analysis (block 3) revealed that, in women, positive coping was significantly associated with PTSD symptoms (β=−0.376, p=0.001). However, the effect of positive coping was not significant in men. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The results suggest that the aftermath of physical violence contributes to the current prevalence of PTSD. The positive effects of social support on PTSD symptoms suggest that it has practical implications for interventions to promote psychological health. The healthcare workers’ coping styles influenced the development of PTSD symptoms. Therefore, adopting effective coping styles and receiving social support have potential roles in the recovery from trauma after experiencing physical violence.",490

The Impact of Event Scale was the most common posttraumatic stress disorder instrument. Between 1 and 6 months post-ICU (six studies; n = 456), the pooled mean (95% CI) Impact of Event Scale score was 20 (17-24), and the pooled prevalences of clinically important posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (95% CI) were 25% (18-34%) and 44% (36-52%) using Impact of Event Scale thresholds greater than or equal to 35 and greater than or equal to 20, respectively. Between 7 and 12 months post-ICU (five studies; n = 698), the pooled mean Impact of Event Scale score was 17 (9-24), and pooled prevalences of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were 17% (10-26%) and 34% (22-50%), respectively. ICU risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms included benzodiazepine administration and post-ICU memories of frightening ICU experiences. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were associated with worse quality of life. In European-based studies: 1) an ICU diary was associated with a significant reduction in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, 2) a self-help rehabilitation manual was associated with significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptom reduction at 2 months, but not 6 months; and 3) a nurse-led ICU follow-up clinic did not reduce posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.Clinically important posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms occurred in one fifth of critical illness survivors at 1-year follow-up, with higher prevalence in those who had comorbid psychopathology, received benzodiazepines, and had early memories of frightening ICU experiences. In European studies, ICU diaries reduced posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.",491

Although the validity of CPTSD has been controversial, a growing number of studies support the distinction between PTSD and CPTSD. However, the majority of this research has originated in high-income countries (HICs), whereas the prevalence of trauma experience associated with PTSD/CPTSD diagnosis is significantly higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Objective: This study assessed whether a sample from an LMIC setting produced distinct classes that reflect ICD-11 criteria for PTSD and CPTSD. Furthermore, this study investigated whether childhood trauma distinguished between PTSD and CPTSD. Method: International Trauma Questionnaire responses from a sample of South African university undergraduates were used as indicator variables in a latent class analysis (LCA). Chi-squared tests of independence and Kruskal–Wallis H tests were used to assess between-class differences. Results: The LCA identified four distinct classes: a PTSD class with elevated symptoms of PTSD, but low endorsement of disturbances in self-organization (DSO; symptoms that are specific to CPTSD); a CPTSD class with elevated symptoms of PTSD and DSO; a DSO class with low symptoms of PTSD, but elevated symptoms of DSO; and a Low class with low endorsements on all symptoms. Regarding childhood trauma, participants in the CPTSD class had more severe childhood abuse and neglect, specifically emotional abuse and neglect, than participants in the PTSD class. Conclusions: Findings were consistent with the distinction between PTSD and CPTSD symptom profiles in the ICD-11. Our findings support a similar qualitative distinction between PTSD and CPTSD in our LMIC context, as previously reported in HICs. This distinction is especially relevant in LMICs because of the significant number of individuals vulnerable to these disorders.",492

However, most of them used the DSM-IV criteria for PTSS and focused on victims following combat, interpersonal violence, and natural disasters, with no studies focusing on cancer patients. To extend the existing literature and fill the gaps in previous studies, this study aims to examine the specific patterns of PTSS and their predictors.One hundred and ninety-one cancer patients were selected to complete self-reported questionnaires; the data analysis involved latent profile analysis and multinomial logistic regression.Three patterns of PTSS were found: the non-symptom group (n = 29, 15.3%), the hyperarousal symptoms group (n = 84, 44.2%), and the severe PTSS group (n = 77, 40.5%). In addition, a longer elapsed time since diagnosis was related to fewer hyperarousal symptoms [OR (95%CI) = 0.98 (0.95-1.00)] and severe PTSS [OR (95%CI) = 0.98 (0.95-1.00)]; a greater fear of cancer recurrence was related to more hyperarousal symptoms [OR (95%CI) = 1.09 (1.00-1.19)] and severe PTSS [OR (95%CI) = 1.32 (1.18-1.47)]; and individuals with higher household incomes [OR (95%CI) = 1.65 (0.96-2.84)] and female patients [OR (95%CI) = 0.37 (0.16-0.87)] had more severe PTSS.Cancer patients exhibited heterogeneous PTSS patterns.",494

Our aim was to identify longitudinal QOL trajectories and determine and predict the sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics of trajectory membership in physical trauma patients using a biopsychosocial approach. Methods Patients completed a questionnaire set after inclusion, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up. Trajectories were identified using repeated-measures latent class analysis. The trajectory characteristics were ranked using Cohen’s d effect size or phi coefficient. Results Altogether, 267 patients were included. The mean age was 54.1 (SD = 16.1), 62% were male, and the median injury severity score was 5.0 [2.0—9.0]. Four latent trajectories were found for psychological health and environment, five for physical health and social relationships, and seven trajectories were found for overall QOL and general health. The trajectories seemed to remain stable over time. For each QOL domain, the identified trajectories differed significantly in terms of anxiety, depressive symptoms, acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, Neuroticism, trait anxiety, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness. Discussion Psychological factors characterized the trajectories during 12 months after trauma. Health care providers can use these findings to identify patients at risk for impaired QOL and offer patient-centered care to improve QOL.",495

The current study replicated the dimensional structure of the PCL-5 and examined the associations of PTSD symptoms with combat exposure, mental health, subjective physical health, and eudaimonic well-being among Korean Veterans. The sample included 345 Korean male Veterans who were deployed to the Vietnam War. Confirmatory factor analyses of the PCL-5 supported the superiority of the 7-factor hybrid model consisting of re-experiencing, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing behaviors, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal. The subscales showed high internal consistencies, ranging from .80 to .93, and were significantly correlated with each other. PTSD symptoms were significantly and positively associated with combat exposure and negative mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and hostility), and inversely associated with emotional well-being, and self-rated health. Conversely, significant relationships between total PTSD symptoms and eudaimonic well-being were not found in this sample. Overall, the current results demonstrate the psychometric adequacy of the PCL-5 translated in Korean. However, further research is needed to ascertain the relationships between PTSD symptoms and eudaimonic well-being among Korean Veterans.",496

However, there is limited research investigating memory for past PTSD symptoms. We asked sexual assault survivors to report their PTSD symptoms and then recall them 6 months later. Overall, symptom recall was consistent with initial reports. However, after dividing participants into PTSD-positive and negative groups, we found that people who were PTSD-negative at follow-up underestimated past PTSD symptom severity while people who were PTSD-positive overestimated past symptoms. For example, 2.8% of PTSD-negative participants versus 15.9% of PTSD-positive participants recalled experiencing 20+ more points on the PCL-5 at follow-up than at initial assessment. Further, people who adjusted over time greatly underestimated past symptoms unlike those who remained PTSD-positive. Our findings have important theoretical and clinical implications because they show that current symptom severity may influence the memory reconstruction of prior levels of adjustment.",497

Having such information is essential for making predictions about service members’ chances of recovery, choosing best treatments, and for understanding if new interventions improve upon the standard of care. Materials and Methods We reviewed data from the Psychological Health Pathways (PHP) database. Psychological Health Pathways is a standardized battery of demographics and psychometric outcome measures, including measurement of PTSD symptom severity, that is collected in military mental health clinics. We examined changes in PTSD symptom severity scores over time and developed logistic regression models to predict who responded to treatment, showed clinical success, or improved to the point that they could likely stay in the military. Results After about 10 weeks in mental health clinics, severity scores for PTSD, sleep, depression, resilience, and disability all improved significantly. Of 681 patients tracked, 38% had clinically significant reductions on the PTSD Checklist (PCL) (i.e., “treatment response”), 28% no longer met criteria for PTSD on the PCL, and 23% did both (i.e., “clinical treatment success”). For the ultimate end point of “military treatment success,” defined as meeting criteria for both clinical treatment success and reporting that their work-related disability was mild or better, 12.8% of patients succeeded. Depression scores were the most powerful predictor of treatment failure. Conclusions Recovery from PTSD is possible during military service, but it is less likely in individuals with certain negative prognostic factors, most notably severe depression.",499

The current IES‐R was developed using World Health Organization (WHO) principles in establishing the comprehensibility, reliability, and validity of translated scales.ResultsGood discriminant validity and good reliability for the scale were identified. Factors analysis supported a four‐factor solution for the PTGI and a three‐factor solution for the IES‐R; however, the small sample size suggests the obtained factor structure is likely unstable.ConclusionThe Arabic version of the IES‐R is a promising scale to assess posttraumatic stress symptoms in Middle Eastern Refugees.",500

Fortunately, prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is a well-researched and highly effective treatment for PTSD. Our recent clinical trial showed that standard 12-session PE was effective for PTSD treatment among inpatients with SCI. Early intervention with brief PE (3-sessions) delivered in the emergency department has also been effective for PTSD prevention, but has not been tested among people post-SCI. Thus, we aim to conduct the first test of the Brief PE intervention to prevent PTSD among patients with SCI.Adults who have experienced a SCI (N = 200) will be randomly assigned during inpatient rehabilitation to either: (a) 3 60-min sessions of Brief PE (intervention group) or (b) treatment as usual (control group).The primary outcome measure (PTSD symptoms measured by the PSSI-5) and secondary outcome measures (depression, anxiety, pain, quality of life, sleep disturbance, and resilience) will be assessed at baseline, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the PE intervention on PTSD and secondary outcomes. Descriptive statistics will examine feasibility and will include the number of participants enrolled, the number of sessions completed, fidelity of Brief PE delivery, and average scores for difficulty and helpfulness of the intervention scales for those randomized to intervention.Successful completion of this study will provide an evidence-based program to alleviate posttraumatic distress post spinal cord injury and prevent long-term development of PTSD.",501

The current study aimed to (1) explore the different trajectories in both PGI and PTSS and (2) examine the associations of the identified trajectories between PGI and PTSS among individuals. The final sample were 419 adults who were physically residing in the area when Hurricane Harvey made landfall on 26 August 2017. The initial data collection occurred approximately 16 months after the Hurricane, and participants were asked to participate again after 1‐ and 3‐month later. A result from the latent growth mixture modeling revealed that for PGI, the 4‐class model was the best‐fitting model, and for PTSS, the 3‐class model was the best‐fitting model. When examining the association between the trajectories of PGI and PSS, individuals classified to higher PGI subgroups were more likely to be associated with the Recovery PTSS subgroup. The current study suggests that disaster survivors with higher PGI were more likely to recover from PTSS, raising an importance of incorporating PGI to alleviate future PTSS.",502

The PTSD Check list-Civilian Version (PCL-C) was used at all time points. Growth mixture models (GMM) were estimated to examine whether individuals could be clustered into discrete groups with similar trajectories. Multinomial logistic regressions were carried out to investigate factors associated with class membership. The three-class GMM was the most parsimonious solution. This included 90.2% in the resilient class, 4.1% in the improving class and 5.7% in the deteriorating class. Both the deteriorating and improving classes were associated with childhood adversity (odds ratios (OR) 3.9 (95% CI 2.3, 6.7) and 3.3 (95% CI 2.1, 5.0) respectively) and antisocial behaviour (OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.9, 4.2) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.4, 5.8) respectively), alcohol misuse (OR 3.5 (95% CI 2.4, 5.1) and 3.3 (95% CI 2.1, 5.2) respectively) and longer time since leaving Service in comparison to the resilient group. Those in the youngest group and those in a combat role (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19, 0.54) were more likely to belong to the deteriorating class. 10% of the cohort had symptoms of PTSD; of those, up to half were symptomatic for most of the follow-up period. Those whose score improved did not reach the low scores of the resilient group. Younger age and combat role were associated with worse prognosis of PTSD.",503

How PTSD is defined may matter. The present study used exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) to replicate and extend prior work by including two models to examine how PTSD (ICD-11, DSM-5), DSO, and BPD symptoms relate. Participants (N = 470; 98.1% women; 97.7% Black) were recruited from medical clinics within an urban hospital. PTSD, CPTSD, and BPD were assessed using semi-structured interviews and trauma-related avoidance, aggressive behavior, and anxious attachment were assessed using self-report measures. ESEM models of PTSD, DSO, and BPD symptoms were run. We found a three-factor ESEM model of CPTSD (ICD-11 PTSD and DSO symptoms) and BPD symptoms best fit the data and found support for discriminant validity between factors across trauma-related avoidance, aggressive behavior, and anxious attachment. For DSM-5 PTSD, a two-factor ESEM model was best-fitting (PTSD and DSO/BPD). The findings demonstrate clear distinguishing and overlapping features of ICD-11 PTSD, CPTSD, and BPD and the necessity to consider the diagnostic structure of PTSD in determining the additive value of CPTSD as a distinct construct.",504

The initial diagnostic factor for both disorders is exposure to a traumatic event. This study aimed to explore whether exposure to different traumatic experiences distinguish risk for PTSD and CPTSD. Methods The study sample comprised 158 trauma-exposed participants, M (SD) age = 33.61(9.73). The Life Events Checklist-Revised (LEC-R) was used to evaluate trauma exposure, and the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) was used to assess risk for ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine traumatic events as predictors of risk for PTSD and CPTSD. Results Analysis revealed that sexual abuse experienced in childhood or adulthood was associated with both PTSD and CPTSD. History of other unwanted sexual experiences and childhood physical abuse predicted CPTSD compared to PTSD, whereas exposure to natural disasters predicted PTSD compared to CPTSD. Conclusions The results showed that experiences of certain traumatic events, such as sexual trauma, childhood physical abuse or natural disasters, might help distinguish risk for PTSD and CPTSD. Nevertheless, future studies on specific aspects of trauma exposure are necessary.",505

The current study sought to determine the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in ABI patients with traumatic and non-traumatic injury. Patients and Methods A cross-sectional research design was used. The assessment of PTSD was carried out by using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5). In the study, there were 132 adults older than 18 years who have ABI—either traumatic or non-traumatic. The study was conducted in a public hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan, and the data was collected one-month post brain injury. Results The results showed that traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients have more PTSD symptoms as compared to non-TBI patients (p = 0.00). Intrusive (p = 0.00) and hyper arousal symptoms (p = 0.04) of PTSD were higher in TBI than in non-TBI patients. There was statically non-significant mean difference in symptoms of PTSD among male and female patients (p = 0.34). The moderately brain injury patients have high PTSD symptoms as compared to mild brain injury patients (p = 0.04). Further, the frequency of severe and extreme PTSD symptoms was high in TBI patient as compared to non TBI patients (p = .05) Conclusion PTSD severity and PTSD symptoms such as intrusive and avoidance symptoms were higher in TBI patients than in non-TBI patients. This study contributed to the literature by assessing the onset of PTSD in patients with acquired brain injury. This study also provided knowledge to plan psychosocial interventions for patients with acquired brain injury having PTSD symptoms.",506

Prior work has suggested self-compassion may only be related to avoidance symptoms using DSM IV criteria. Changes to the diagnosis in DSM 5 may have changed these relations. The current study examined the relation between self-compassion and PTSD symptoms using DSM IV and DSM 5 criteria. PTSD symptoms and self-compassion were evaluated in two trauma-exposed samples using measures that corresponded to DSM IV and DSM 5 criteria. Self-compassion was negatively correlated with aggregated PTSD symptoms for DSM IV and DSM 5. Self-compassion was correlated with avoidance symptoms for DSM IV but was correlated with all symptom clusters for the DSM 5. These results suggest that self-compassion may protect against PTSD symptoms using the most recent diagnostic criteria.,507

Conversely, we aim to evaluate how early onset of alcohol, tobacco and psychoactive drugs use are associated with PTSD later in life. 2,193 brazilian young adults completed modularized assessments: The Trauma History Questionnaire, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C, transformed to PCL-5 through a crosswalk procedure), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale; and a survey on drug use with self-report questions about first use, current use, frequency, quantity, and interpersonal consequences. Bayesian inference and multivariate regression models were used to examine the effects on the risk of PTSD, considering different assumptions of information flow. Raw and unbiased (multivariate) estimates consistently revealed that earlier age of onset of alcohol and tobacco use increased risk for PTSD (Odds-ratios between 2.39 and 3.19 (Alcohol) and 1.82 to 2.05 (Tobacco). Among those who had PTSD (310), 10.3% (32) were very precocious at the onset age (12 to 18 years) of alcohol consumption (No-PTSD: 89 out 1883, 4.7%). Data supports a model in which age of onset effects are partially mediated by the number of trauma exposures. Early intoxication might suggest vulnerability for qualifying trauma events, or it may increase chances of exposure. Also, PTSD may be more likely to occur among trauma-exposed individuals with early intoxicating experiences due to alcohol or drug self-administration. The last possibility resonates with the idea that early intoxication might disrupt adolescent brain development, with a subsequent reduction in resilience when qualifying trauma events occur.",508

The inclusion of DSM-5's PTSD D3 criterion (blaming self or others for the stressful experience) has received little research attention in regard to its relation to post-trauma mental health outcomes. To address this gap in literature, we examined the relevance of the clinical endorsement of the D3 criterion to PTSD symptomology and other posttrauma mental health outcomes.Participants were 123 trauma-exposed, treatment-seeking individuals (Mage = 35.70, 68.3% female) who completed a series of self-report questionnaires assessing PTSD symptomology, depression severity, distress intolerance, rumination, and anger reactions.Independent t tests comparing those that clinically endorsed the D3 criterion (vs. those that did not) revealed that the clinical endorsement of blame was significantly associated with PTSD severity, depression, distress intolerance, and rumination.Our findings support the significance of PTSD's D3 criterion, and further emphasize the importance of addressing blame in posttrauma mental health outcomes.

We therefore performed a survey addressing several symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients who sustained multiple injuries more than 20 years after trauma.Patients injured between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 1990, were contacted at least 20 years later. We included multiply injured patients aged between 3 and 60 years from a single level 1 trauma center. A questionnaire based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnostic criteria for PTSD, including individual symptoms related to intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal was sent to all patients.A total of 359 patients (56.35%) received a questionnaire. Of these, 337 patients (93.87%) returned the questionnaire and were included in the study (223 males [66.17%] and 114 females [33.82%]). Mean ± SD follow-up was 29.5 ± 8.5 years. Nearly half the study population (47.18%) experienced lasting psychiatric sequelae, such as intrusive recollection (n = 65, 19.28%), avoidance (n = 92, 27.29%), or hyperarousal (n = 95, 28.18%) at least monthly. Ten patients (2.96%) fulfilled all Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnostic criteria for PTSD. A total of 131 patients (38.87%) reported fair or poor general health status.

Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of elevated ACS-related PTSD symptoms [PCL-S ≥ 33] at 1-month associated with PTSD symptoms due to prior trauma and prior trauma type at the time of suspected ACS, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, depression, and etiology of ACS symptoms.Of 984 patients, 81.6% reported ≥1 prior trauma type and 22.5% reported PTSD symptoms due to prior trauma at the time of suspected ACS. One month later, 18.0% had ACS-related PTSD symptoms. Patients with versus without PTSD symptoms due to prior trauma at the time of the suspected ACS had increased odds of ACS-related PTSD symptoms one month later (42.1% vs 9.9%; aOR 4.49, 95% CI:3.05-6.60; p < .001). Prior life-threatening illness was the only trauma type significantly associated with ACS-related PTSD symptoms (aOR 1.57, 95% CI:1.03-2.39; p = .04).PTSD symptoms from prior trauma and history of life-threatening medical illness at the time of suspected ACS increased risk of ACS-related PTSD symptoms one month later.",512

Participants provided demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics and completed the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, and the WHOQOL-BREF. We identified covariates through bivariate correlations or linear regressions as appropriate. Six multiple regression models (three each for survivors and caregivers) examined associations between PCL-5 scores with each QoL subscale, adjusted for covariates identified from the bivariate models.We included 169 survivors (mean months since arrest: 62.8, positive PTS screen: 24.9%) and 52 caregivers (mean months since arrest: 43.2, positive PTS screen: 34.6%). For survivors, the following showed significant bivariate associations with QoL: Lawton scores, daily memory problems, sex, months since arrest, age, and income; for caregivers, months since arrest, age, and income. In adjusted models, greater PCL-5 scores were associated with worse QoL (β: -0.35 to -0.53, p < .05).Our pilot results suggest that PTS are prevalent years after the initial cardiac arrest and are associated with worse QoL in survivors and informal caregivers. Further study is needed to validate these findings in a larger, representative sample.",513

However, no clear consensus has been reached regarding the postdisaster trajectories of PTSD among children.Objective: The current study examined the trajectories of PTSD among children after exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake and explored potential predictors of distinct PTSD trajectories.Methods: A four-year longitudinal study was conducted to follow 301 children who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms following the Wenchuan earthquake. Trauma exposure and some pre-existing characteristics were measured at four months after the disaster, and PTSD symptoms were measured at 4, 16, 29, 40 and 52 months after the disaster. The trajectories were identified with Latent Growth Mixture Modelling, and the predictors were explored with multinomial logistic regression.Results: The following three latent PTSD trajectories were found among children: resilient (74.9%), relapsing (17.7%) and recovery (7.5%). Trauma exposure was more likely to be related to a more severe trajectory of PTSD, having experienced prequake trauma was more likely to be related to the recovery trajectory and school 2 was more likely to be related to the relapsing trajectory.Conclusion: These findings provide novel insights into children’s postdisaster response patterns. Individual heterogeneity existed in posttraumatic reactions. This longer-term longitudinal study captured more detailed and accurate information about the development of these trajectories.

The factors that increase the likelihood of a child developing PTSD need further clarification. We studied the factors associated with PTSD among children who experienced the tsunami in Sumatra, Indonesia. We conducted a cross sectional study in 2 subdistricts of Sumatra 5 years after experiencing a tsunami. Children aged 7-13 years were enrolled using stratified cluster sampling. A tsunami-modified version of The PsySTART Rapid Triage System was used to question children about their tsunami-specific traumatic experiences. Trauma symptoms were evaluated using the Trauma Symptom Checklist For Children (TSCC). The diagnosis of PTSD was made using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) and DSM-IV criteria. The data were analyzed with chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 262 children were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of PTSD in these children was 20.6%. On multivariate analysis, having experienced a delay in evacuation (PR = 4.5; 95% CI: 2.794-13.80; p < 0.001) and being unable to escape (PR = 13.07; 95% CI: 5.884-64; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with PTSD 5 years after the tsunami. Children who experienced a traumatic event in which they were unable to escape or when there is a delay in evacuation are at risk of developing PTSD and need appropriate treatment.",515

This study investigated relationships between self-reported blast exposure, mTBI history, and current post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in a population of active duty service members (n = 202) from the Intensive Outpatient Program at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence.Participants were divided into four mTBI groups (0, 1, 2, and 3+) and four blast exposure groups (0-10, 11-100, 101-1,000, and 1,000+). Self-reported lifetime mTBI and blast history were obtained via the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method. PTSS severity was obtained via the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C). Several secondary measures of depression, anxiety, chronic mTBI symptoms, and sleep were also assessed.The total PCL-C scores differed significantly between mTBI groups, with significant differences detected between the 0/1 mTBI groups and the 3+ mTBI groups. Similar group differences were noted across the three PCL-C subgroup scores (avoidance, re-experiencing, and hyperarousal); however, when comparing the proportion of group participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for each symptom cluster, significant differences between mTBI groups were only noted for avoidance (P = .002). No group differences were noted in PTS symptom severity or distribution between blast groups.This study demonstrates an association between lifetime mTBI history and PTS symptom severity and distribution but failed to identify the significant group in self-reported symptoms between the blast exposure groups. Results suggest that additional research is needed to understand the neurobiological mechanism behind these associations and the need for the development of precise assessment tools that are able to more accurately quantify significant lifetime sub-concussive and blast exposures experienced by service members in training and combat operations.",516

This study builds on prior work by accounting for delivery of specific evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for PTSD while identifying potential predictors of clinical improvement using patient-reported outcomes measurement.Our sample consisted of 2 643 US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatients who initiated treatment for PTSD between 2008 and 2013 and received at least four PTSD checklist (PCL) measurements over 12 weeks. We obtained PCL data as well as demographic, diagnostic, and health services use information from the VA corporate data warehouse. We used latent trajectory analysis to identify classes of patients based on PCL scores, then determined demographic, diagnostic, and treatment predictors of membership in each class.Patients who met our PCL-based inclusion criteria were far more likely than those who did not receive EBTs. We identified two latent trajectories of PTSD symptoms. Patients in the substantial improvement group (25.9%) had a mean decrease in PCL score of 16.24, whereas patients in the modest improvement group improved by a mean of 8.09 points. However, there were few differences between the groups, and our model to predict group membership was only slightly better than chance (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.55). Of the 64 covariates we tested, the only robust individual predictor of improvement was gender, with men having lower odds of being in the substantial improvement group compared with women (odds ratio [OR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.96).VA patients with PTSD can realize significant improvement in routine clinical practice. Although available medical records-based variables were generally insufficient to predict improvement trajectory, this study did indicate that men have lower odds of substantial improvement than women.",517

We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was −24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and −13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation. Appeared originally in Nat Med 2021; 27:1025–1033",519

Assessments included the PTSD checklist (PCL); the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS); the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); the Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile (AASP); the SF36 Quality of Life instrument; and a brief, structured pre-enrolment assessment of attitudes towards yoga. Biomarkers were also assessed. Results: Thirty participants were recruited, with 28 completing the protocol ( M age =63.5 years). For most variables, there was no significant change in results after the waiting period. Comparing measurements obtained immediately prior to the commencement of the intervention to those taken after completion of eight yoga sessions, significant changes included an increase in the serum dehydroepiandrosterone concentration, decreased total PCL score (and all PCL sub-scales), decreases in all DASS sub-scale scores and significant improvements in PSQI and SF36 scores. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: A range of benefits were observed after yoga, consistent with the theoretical construct for the long history of yoga as a strategy to reduce stress and promote well-being.",520

This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly translated Bangla PCL-5. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 10,605 individuals (61.0% male; mean age: 23.6±5.5 [13-71 years]) during May and June 2020, several months after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. The survey included Bangla PCL-5 and PHQ-9 depression scale. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test the four-factor DSM-5 model, the six-factor Anhedonia model, and the seven-factor Hybrid model. Results: Bangla PCL-5 displayed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90). The Bangla PCL-5 score was significantly correlated with scores of the PHQ-9 depression scale. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated the models had a good fit to the data, including the four-factor DSM-5 model, the six-factor Anhedonia model, and the seven-factor Hybrid model. Conclusions : The Bangla PCL-5 appears to be a valid and reliable psychometric screening tool that may be employed in the prospective evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder in Bangladesh.",521
https://openalex.org/W2907019276,,The Influence of Pain on the Development of PTSD Across the Acute Post Trauma Period,"Exposure to potentially traumatic events is fairly common among US adults, yet only a small fraction develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear, however, why some individuals develop PTSD and others do not. Higher pain after a traumatic injury has been associated with higher PTSD symptomology and may be a risk factor for developing PTSD. However, few studies have examined symptoms during the period immediately after a trauma to determine how they relate to PTSD outcome. The goal of this study was to identify trajectories of pain throughout the first month after a traumatic injury and examine their relation to PTSD symptoms at 1 month. A sample of (n = 88) individuals who had experienced a traumatic injury assessed their pain through daily mobile assessments for the first month after injury. Daily mobile assessments consisted of self-report surveys sent to the participants’ mobile device. A follow-up interview was conducted at 1 month after injury to assess PTSD symptomology. Using growth mixture modeling, three trajectories of pain were identified: low pain, decreasing pain, and persistent high pain. Membership to the low pain group was associated with lower PTSD, depression and disability symptoms at 1 month after injury. Membership to the high pain group was associated with higher levels of PTSD, depression and disability symptoms at 1 month. These results demonstrate that there are distinct trajectories of pain after a traumatic injury and these trajectories may relate to later symptoms of psychopathology.",522

Data from three waves of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999–2007) (NSCAW; National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2002) were analyzed to investigate the change trajectories of both externalizing and PTS symptomatology among children with a substantiated report of child maltreatment by Child Protective Services (CPS) between October 1999 and December 2000. This study uses data collected at three time points: baseline and approximately 18 (Wave 3) and 36 (Wave 4) months post-baseline. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale measured externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current trauma-related symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model with a sample of n = 280 maltreated youth between the ages of 8 and 15 following home removal. Findings revealed that initial levels of externalizing and PTS symptomatology were both significantly and positively related and co-develop over time. Externalizing symptom severity remained in the borderline range during the first two years in out-of-home care. Both direct and indirect forms of interpersonal violence exposure were associated with initial level of externalizing symptom and PTS symptom severity, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest an underlying process that links early violence exposure to the co-development and cumulative impact of PTS on externalizing behavior above and beyond experiences of maltreatment. We conclude by discussing the key points of intervention that result from a more nuanced understanding of the longitudinal relationship between PTS and externalizing symptoms and the effect of complex trauma on growth in these symptoms over time.",523

Assessing families' psychosocial risk factors is a crucial part of trauma-informed practice as it helps identify risk for PTSS in the aftermath of PTME.Using the Psychosocial Assessment Tool 2.0 (PAT2.0), this study describes the psychosocial risk of families following PTMEs in two ways: 1. Describing the psychosocial risk defined by the PAT2.0 based on three-tiered risk levels; 2. Using latent profile analysis (LPA); identifying psychosocial risk profiles and examining how child- and injury-related factors can affect profile membership.Caregivers of 374 children following PTMEs admitted to a pediatric rehabilitation department in Israel completed the PAT2.0. Total PAT2.0 score and the seven PAT2.0 subscales (family structure/resources, social support, child problems, sibling problems, family problems, caregiver stress reactions, and family beliefs) were included in the first analysis. Mean PAT2.0 scores of three risk categories (universal, targeted, clinical) were calculated; LPA, which allows for cross-sectional latent variable mixture models to identify heterogeneity within a population, and multinomial logistic regressions using six out of the seven PAT2.0 subscales, were used to determine distinct profile differences and predictors of profile membership.The three-tiered risk levels revealed were relatively high, as compared to levels in families of children with other clinical diagnoses. LPA yielded a three-profile solution: low family risk (63.53%); high caregiver stress, above-average levels of family risk (22.5%); and sibling problems, above-average levels of family risk (13.94%). Ethnicity and type of injury predicted group membership.Families of children following PTMEs are at increased psychosocial risk. A clinically useful approach to identifying and preventing PTSS may be to evaluate specific domain patterns rather than just the total PAT2.0 risk level alone, based on the PAT2.0 subscales.Antecedentes: Síntomas de estrés postraumático (SEPT) a menudo son experimentados por los niños y miembros de la familia después de eventos médicos pediátricos traumáticos (PTME, por sus siglas en inglés). La evaluación de los factores de riesgo psicosocial de las familias es una parte crucial de la práctica informada sobre el trauma, ya que ayuda a identificar el riesgo de SEPT después de PTME.Objetivos: Usando la Herramienta de Evaluación Psicosocial 2.0 (PAT2.0), este estudio describe el riesgo psicosocial de las familias luego de un PTME de dos maneras: 1. Describiendo el riesgo psicosocial definido por la PAT2.0 basado en niveles de riesgo en tres niveles; 2. Usando un análisis de perfiles latentes (LPA, por sus siglas en inglés); identificar perfiles de riesgo psicosocial y examinar cómo los factores relacionados con los niños y las lesiones pueden afectar la pertenencia al perfil.Métodos: Los cuidadores de 374 niños después de un PTME admitidos en un departamento de rehabilitación pediátrica en Israel completaron el PAT2.0. En el primer análisis se incluyeron la puntuación total de PAT2.0 y las siete subescalas de PAT2.0 (estructura/recursos familiares, apoyo social, problemas de los niños, problemas de hermanos, problemas familiares, reacciones de estrés del cuidador y creencias familiares). Se calcularon las puntuaciones medias de PAT2.0 de tres categorías de riesgo (universal, específico, clínico); se usaron LPA, que permite crear modelos transversales de una mezcla de las variables latentes para identificar la heterogeneidad dentro de una población, y regresiones logísticas multinomiales usando seis de las siete subescalas PAT2.0, para determinar distintas diferencias de perfil y predictores de membresía al perfil.Resultados: Los tres niveles de riesgo revelados fueron relativamente altos, en comparación con los niveles en familias de niños con otros diagnósticos clínicos. LPA arrojó una solución de tres perfiles: bajo riesgo familiar (63,53%); alto estrés del cuidador, niveles de riesgo familiar superiores a la media (22,5%); y problemas entre hermanos, niveles de riesgo familiar superiores a la media (13,94%). La pertenencia étnica y el tipo de lesión pronosticaron la pertenencia al grupo.Conclusión: Las familias de niños que presentan PTME tienen un mayor riesgo psicosocial. Un enfoque clínicamente útil para identificar y prevenir el TEPT puede ser evaluar patrones de dominio específicos en lugar de solo el nivel de riesgo total de PAT2.0, basado en las subescalas de PAT2.0.背景：儿童和家人在儿科创伤性医疗事件 (PTME) 后经常经历创伤后应激症状 (PTSS)。评估家庭的心理社会风险因素是创伤知情实践的重要组成部分，因为它有助于识别 PTME 后发生 PTSS 的风险。目的：本研究使用心理社会评估工具 2.0（PAT2.0），从两个方面描述PTME 后家庭的心理社会风险： 1. 根据基于三层风险水平的PAT2.0 定义的心理社会风险描述； 2.使用潜在剖面分析（LPA）；识别心理社会风险剖面并考查儿童和伤害相关因素如何影响剖面所属。方法：以色列一家儿科康复科收治的 374 名 PTME 患儿的照顾者完成了 PAT2.0。 PAT2.0 总分和 7 个 PAT2.0 分量表（家庭结构/资源、社会支持、儿童问题、兄弟姐妹问题、家庭问题、照顾者应激反应和家庭信念）被纳入了首次分析中。计算了三个风险类别的PAT2.0 平均得分（通用、靶向、临床）； LPA 允许横截面潜在变量混合模型识别群体内的异质性，并使用七个 PAT2.0 分量表中的六个进行多项逻辑回归，用于确定不同剖面差异和剖面所属的预测因素。结果：与具有其他临床诊断的儿童家庭的水平相比，显示的三层风险水平相对较高。 LPA 产生了一个三剖面的结果：低家庭风险（63.53%）；照顾者高应激、平均水平以上家庭风险（22.5%）；和有兄弟姐妹问题、平均水平以上家庭风险（13.94%）。种族和伤害类型预测了组别所属。结论：PTME后儿童家庭的社会心理风险增加。基于 PAT2.0 分量表，识别和预防 PTSS 的临床有用方法可能是评估特定领域模式，而不仅仅是单独的总 PAT2.0 风险水平。.",524

The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma reports that early screening and referral has the potential to improve outcomes and that further study of screening and intervention for PTSD would be beneficial. This prospective randomized study screened hospitalized patients for traumatic stress reactions and assessed the effect of a brief intervention in reducing later development of PTSD. METHODS The Primary Care PTSD (PC-PTSD) screen was administered to admitted patients. Patients with symptoms were randomized to an intervention or control group. The brief intervention focused on symptom education and normalization, coping strategies, and utilizing supports. The control group received a 3-minute educational brochure review. Both groups completed in-hospital interviews, then 45- and 90-day telephone interviews. Follow-up collected the PTSD checklist-civilian (PCL-C) assessment and qualitative data on treatment-seeking barriers. RESULTS The PC-PTSD screen was successful in predicting later PTSD symptoms at both 45 days ( β = 0.43, p &lt; 0.001) and 90 days ( β = 0.37, p &lt; 0.001) even after accounting for depression. Correlations of the intervention with the PCL-C scores and factor score estimates did not reach statistical significance at either time point ( p = 0.827; p = 0.838), indicating that the brief intervention did not decrease PTSD symptoms over time. Of those at or above the PCL-C cutoff at follow-ups, a minority had sought treatment for their symptoms (43.2%). Primary barriers included focusing on their injury or ongoing rehabilitation, financial concerns, or location of residence. CONCLUSION The PC-PTSD screen identified patients who later assess positive for PTSD using the PCL-C. The brief intervention did not reduce 45- and 90-day PTSD development. Follow-up interviews revealed lack of treatment infrastructure in the community. It will be important for trauma centers to align with community resources to address the treatment needs of at-risk patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prospective randomized controlled trial, level II.",525

We tested the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity. The participants were 317 Portuguese adolescents (53% females) between 13 and 17 years old who had experienced at least one traumatic event or one childhood adversity. A subset of the sample (n = 85) completed test-retest measures (interval range between 5 and 7 months). Analyses revealed good to excellent internal consistencies, moderate to good agreement test-retest reliability, and good convergent validity.

Memory theory purports that the development of PTSD can be explained by dysfunctional trauma cognitions, high sensory and poor articulation of trauma memories, and poor emotional regulation. The purpose of this paper are as follows: (1) to describe trauma experiences and PTSD symptoms of a high-risk sample of low-income urban youth and (2) to explore if post-traumatic cognitions, trauma memory quality, or emotional regulation means differ in participants screening positive for PTSD as compared with those that did not screen positive. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A preliminary sample of low-income, urban adolescents (ages 16–21) at risk for homelessness took a web-based, self-report survey responding to questions related to their experiences of trauma and mental health (n=48). PTSD was measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 criteria (PCL_5). A cut-off of 33 was used as a positive screen for PTSD. Post-traumatic cognitions was measured with the post-traumatic cognition inventory (pcti) with higher scores representing greater dysfunctions and negative cognitions. Trauma memory was measured with the Trauma Memory Quality Questionnaire (TMQQ) with higher scores representing more sensory-based and poorly verbalized memories. Emotional regulation was measured using the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS) with higher scores representing greater difficulties with emotional regulation. All 3 variables conceptually represented theoretical constructs of the development of PTSD. Initial data from the baseline survey was used conducted a 1-way ANOVA to compare the difference in post-traumatic cognition, quality of trauma memory, and emotional regulation in those that screened positive for PTSD as compared with their peers. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The majority of this population (80%) experienced at least 1 traumatic life event. This sample experienced an average of 10.5 lifetime traumas (SD=10.6). Of those experiencing trauma about 20% (n=8) reported a positive PTSD screen (PCL-5). There were significant group differences among those screening positive for PTSD and their peers in the following variables: (1) pcti ( F 1,24 =10.43, p &lt;0.004), (2) TMQQ ( F 1,29 =11.02, p &lt;0.002), and (3) DERS ( F 1,36 =19.68, p =0.000). The majority of this population (80%) experienced at least one traumatic life event. This sample experienced an average of 10.5 lifetime traumas (SD=10.6). Of those experiencing trauma about 20% (N=8) reported a positive PTSD screen (PCL-5). There were significant group differences among those screening positive for PTSD and their peers in the following variables: 1) pcti [F(1,24) = 10.43, p&lt;.004], 2) TMQQ [F(1,29) =11.02, p&lt;.002], [F(1,36) =19.68, p=.000]. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: This sample reported high rates of trauma and PTSD. Constructs representing memory theory (cognition dysfunction, quality of memory, and emotional regulation) all significantly differed among participants with PTSD compared with their peers. Consequently, it may be useful for trauma interventions to target the maladaptive post-traumatic cognitions, quality of traumatic memories, and emotional regulation in this population. These results will inform work that aims to explore if a trauma intervention, based on the memory theory can improve PTSD symptoms. Anticipated data collection completion in March 2017 (n=120).",527

Traumatically injured patients (N = 1,035) were assessed during hospital admission and at 3 (85%) and 12 months (73%). Quality of life prior to traumatic injury was measured with the World Health Organization Quality of Life–BREF during hospitalization and at each subsequent assessment. PTSD was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale at 3 and 12 months. After controlling for preinjury functioning, current pain, and comorbid depression, patients whose PTSD symptoms had resolved by 12 months were more likely to have poorer quality of life in psychological (OR = 3.51), physical (OR = 10.17), social (OR = 4.54), and environmental (OR = 8.83) domains than those who never developed PTSD. These data provide initial evidence that PTSD can result in lingering effects on functional capacity even after remission of symptoms.

In line with the DSM–5 changes, an updated version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS–5) was released. The CAPS–5 is considered to be the gold-standard measure of PTSD; however, examinations of the psychometric properties and optimal factor structure of this scale are underrepresented in PTSD studies. Methods: This study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the factor structure of the CAPS–5 using a sample of 267 male Australian Vietnam Veterans. Models drawn from the PTSD CFA literature were used to test the underlying dimensions of PTSD: the four-factor DSM–5 model, six-factor externalizing behaviour and anhedonia models, and seven-factor hybrid model. Results: The results found that the DSM–5 model showed slightly less than adequate fit (comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.90, Tucker–Lewis index [TLI] = 0.88, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.064), however, other models showed acceptable fit. The anhedonia model provided a significantly better fit than the other models (CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.059). Discussion: Overall, the results supported the anhedonia model. This result may indicate that the underlying dimensions of PTSD in Australian Vietnam Veterans may best be represented by six distinct factors.",531
https://openalex.org/W2591617946,10.7205/milmed-d-16-00187,Screening for Anger and Sleep Difficulties,"Introduction: Mental health screens are designed to detect individuals at risk of psychological disorders. In the military setting of this study, these disorders were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use. This study extends the literature on deployment-related mental health screening by including measures of sleep difficulties and anger as predictors of postdeployment PTSD and alcohol abuse. Evidence that measures of anger and sleep difficulties contribute incremental validity to the prediction of postdeployment mental health problems, including substance abuse, would be helpful in designing interventions to assist the rehabilitation of returning personnel. Materials and Methods: A test battery containing the PTSD Checklist–Civilian (PCL-C) to screen for PTSD, the Kessler 10 to screen for psychological distress, a Sleep Difficulties scale, an exposure to trauma scale, and an anger scale was administered to 212 personnel nearing completion of a deployment to the Middle East. A second battery containing the PCL-C, the Kessler 10, and a measure of alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT]) was administered to the same personnel 3 to 6 months after return to Australia. Hierarchical regression analyses assessed the predictive validity of measures of psychological distress (anxiety and depression), PTSD symptomatology, sleep disturbance, and anger in relation to postdeployment measures of PTSD symptomatology and alcohol use. Results: Time 1 measures predicted 24.4% of the variance in postdeployment PCL-C scores and 13.1% of the variance in AUDIT scores, with the Sleep Difficulties scale contributing to the prediction of the PCL-C score and the anger scale helping to predict AUDIT scores. Conclusion: On the basis of these findings, we recommend the inclusion of improved measures of both anger and sleep difficulties in end-of-deployment mental health screens. A less behaviorally specific and more wide-ranging anger scale is recommended for future studies that aim to evaluate the role of anger in screening batteries. Our findings suggest that the Sleep Difficulties scale used in this study would be a worthwhile addition to mental health screening because it is moderately correlated with both Time 1 and Time 2 measures of PTSD symptomatology and psychological distress. Furthermore, there is minimal stigma associated with the experience of sleep difficulties.",532

These renewed experiences of traumatic and stressful life events may lead to an increase in trauma-related mental health symptoms.In a longitudinal study, the effects of renewed experiences of a trauma or stressful life event were examined. For this purpose, refugees seeking asylum in Germany were assessed for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS), Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), anxiety, and depression (Hopkins Symptom Checklist [HSCL-25]) before treatment start as well as after 6 and 12 months during treatment (N=46). Stressful life events and traumatic events were recorded monthly. If a new event happened, PDS and HSCL were additionally assessed directly afterwards. Mann-Whitney U-tests were performed to calculate the differences between the group that experienced an additional critical event (stressful vs. trauma) during treatment (n=23) and the group that did not (n=23), as well as differences within the critical event group between the stressful life event group (n=13) and the trauma group (n=10).Refugees improved significantly during the 12-month period of our study, but remained severely distressed. In a comparison of refugees with a new stressful life event or trauma, significant increases in PTS, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were found directly after the experience, compared to the group without a renewed event during the 12 months of treatment. With regard to the different critical life events (stressful vs. trauma), no significant differences were found regarding overall PTS, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Only avoidance symptoms increased significantly in the group experiencing a stressful life event.Although all clinicians should be aware of possible PTS symptom reactivation, especially those working with refugees and asylum seekers, who often experience new critical life events, should understand symptom fluctuation and address it in treatment.",533

Thus, the potential of MBC is to provide the infrastructure for a flexible, patient-centered approach to evidence-based care. However, MBC is underutilized across the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinics, likely because no actionable, empirically determined guidelines for using repeated measurement effectively are currently available to clinicians. With data collected as part of routine care in VA PTSD specialty clinics across the United States in the year prior to COVID-19 (n = 2,182), we conducted a proof-of-concept for a method of generating session-by-session benchmarks of probable patient nonresponse to treatment, which can be visualized alongside individual patient data using the most common measure of PTSD symptoms used in VA specialty clinics, the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (PCL-5). Using survival analysis, we first identified the probability of cases reaching clinically significant change at each session, as well as any significant moderators of treatment response. We then generated a multilevel model with initial symptom burden predicting the trajectory of PCL-5 scores across sessions. Finally, we determined the slowest changing 50% and 60% of all cases to generate benchmarks at each session for each level of the predictor(s) and then assessed the accuracy of these benchmarks at each session for classifying treatment responders and nonresponders. The final models were able to accurately identify nonresponders as early as the sixth session of treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",534

The purpose of our study is to assess the efficacy and safety level of neurofeedback treatment in patients with PTSD using quantitative EEG.This is a randomized, waitlist-controlled, assessor-blinded, clinical trial. Forty-six patients with PTSD will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio into two groups. The participants in the treatment group will receive neurofeedback treatment for 50 min, twice a week, for 8 weeks (16 sessions). Quantitative EEG will be utilized to monitor the physiological functions and brain waves of the participants. A four-week follow-up period is planned. The participants in the control group will wait for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the Korean version of PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5-K) score. The PCL-5-K scores on week 8 will be compared between the two groups. Anxiety, depression, insomnia, emotions, EEG, quality-of-life, and safety level will be assessed as secondary outcomes.This trial will describe a clinical research methodology for neurofeedback in patients with PTSD. The numerous subjective and objective secondary outcomes add to the value of this trial's results. It will also suggest a therapeutic strategy for utilizing quantitative EEG in patients with PTSD. Our trial will provide basic evidence for the management of PTSD via an integrative treatment.Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS): KCT0003271.",536

Earlier identification of at-risk trauma victims can facilitate efficient and appropriate intervention efforts.Using latent class growth analysis, we examined daily PTSS trajectories beginning 6 weeks postinjury in 68 injury victims. Resulting classes were compared on key characteristics at 6 and 21 weeks postinjury.Three trajectories were identified: a nonreactive class (67.8%) with low initial symptom levels that remained low, a moderate-stable class (27.9%) with elevated symptom levels that remained constant, and a severe-increasing class (4.4%) with high symptom levels that increased.High-risk injury victims can be identified by their daily PTSS, allowing for early identification of those at risk for elevated distress and in greater need for intervention.

We examined predictors of warzone-related PTSD over a 25-year span using data from the National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study (NVVLS). Methods The NVVLS is a follow-up study of Vietnam theater veterans (N = 699) previously assessed in the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS), a large national-probability study conducted in the late 1980s. We examined the ability of 22 premilitary, warzone, and postmilitary variables to predict current warzone-related PTSD symptom severity and PTSD symptom change in male theater veterans participating in the NVVLS. Data included a self-report Health Questionnaire survey and a computer-assisted telephone Health Interview Survey. Primary outcomes were self-reported PTSD symptoms assessed by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL 5) and Mississippi PTSD Scale (M-PTSD). Results Predictors of current PTSD symptoms most robust in hierarchical multivariable models were African-American race, lower education level, negative homecoming reception, lower current social support, and greater past-year stress. PTSD symptoms remained largely stable over time, and symptom exacerbation was predicted by African-American race, lower education level, younger age at entry into Vietnam, greater combat exposure, lower current social support, and greater past-year stressors. Conclusions Findings confirm the robustness of a select set of risk factors for warzone-related PTSD, establishing that these factors can predict PTSD symptom severity and symptom change up to 40 years postdeployment.",538
https://openalex.org/W3176119912,10.1037/tra0001049,Scoring the Life Events Checklist: Comparison of three scoring methods.,"Prior trauma history is a reliable and robust risk predictor for PTSD development. Obtaining an accurate measurement of prior trauma history is critical in research of trauma-related outcomes. The Life Events Checklist (LEC) is a widely used self-report measure of trauma history that categorizes events by the proximity to trauma exposure; however, the field has published multiple scoring methods when assessing the LEC. Herein, we propose a novel scoring procedure in which total scores from the LEC are weighted according to the proximity of trauma exposure with ""experienced"" events weighted most and ""learned about"" events weighted least.The utility of this weighted score was assessed in two traumatically-injured civilian samples and compared against previously published scoring methods, including a nonweighted score including all events experienced, witnessed, and learned about, as well as a score consisting of only experienced events.Results indicated the standard total score was most reliable, followed by the weighted score. The experienced events score was least reliable, but the best predictor of future PTSD symptoms.One method to balance the predictive strength of experienced events and the excellent reliability of a total LEC score, is to adopt the newly proposed weighted score. Future use of this weighted scoring method can provide a comprehensive estimate of lifetime trauma exposure while still emphasizing the direct proximity of experienced events compared with other degrees of exposure.

Methods We performed systematic searches of peer‐reviewed papers in English referenced in Pubmed, Embase, or PsycINFO and ascertained 34 prospective studies of PTSD symptom trajectories identified by latent class growth statistical modeling. Studies with delayed and low‐stable trajectories provided appropriate data for this study. We computed the difference between the delayed trajectory PTSD symptom sumscore and the low‐stable PTSD sumscore at the observed points in time after the traumatic event(s). Results In 29 study populations, the latent class growth analyses displayed delayed trajectories, and in these, we identified 110 data points (% PTSD sumscore difference/months since traumatic exposure). The median PTSD symptom sumscore was 25% higher during the initial 6 months among individuals in the delayed trajectory compared to those in low‐stable trajectory. From this level, the difference widened and reached a plateau of 40–50% higher. The variation was large, and the baseline participation rate and loss to follow‐up were exceeding 25% in the majority of the studies. Heterogeneity of populations, measures, and analyses precluded formal meta‐analysis. Conclusion Delayed PTSD is preceded by PTSD symptoms during the first year in most cases. Still, few individuals may experience an asymptomatic delay. The results underpin the rationale for monitoring PTSD symptoms and may inform forensic assessments in that delayed PTSD without symptoms bridging the traumatic event is rare.",540

Latent class analyses (LCAs) in refugees have identified subgroups that differ in symptom profiles of PTSD and comorbid symptoms. However, knowledge on longitudinal symptom profiles in refugees is sparse. Examining longitudinal PTSD and depression symptom profiles could provide information on risk factors underlying worsening of symptoms post-resettlement. Self-rated PTSD (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) symptoms were assessed among 613 refugees who had resettled in Australia up to two years previously (W1) and at 6 months follow-up (W2). PTSD and depression symptom profiles were identified using LCAs for W1 and W2 separately. Latent transition analysis was used to examine (predictors of) changes in symptom profiles, including gender, age, trauma exposure, and PMLDs. Four classes were identified that were consistent across timepoints: a No symptoms (W1 61%; W2 68%), Low PTSD/Moderate depression (W1 16%; W2 10%), Moderate PTSD/depression (W1 16%; W2 14%), and High symptoms class (W1 7%; W2 7%). Higher levels of problems with PMLDs, including being discrimination and family separation, predicted movements out of the No symptom class at W1 to classes with psychopathology at W2. To conclude, most participants did not develop PTSD or depression symptoms. The risk of developing these symptoms seems higher when problems with interpersonal PMLDs increased, pointing to the need for considering these stressors when addressing the mental health needs in this population.",541

However, the psychiatric sequela of CTS and the relevance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria in this situation have yet to be determined. Filling this gap, the present study assessed psychiatric reactions to CTS and the relationship between such reactions and functional impairment among two representative samples of adults exposed to ongoing shelling over 6 (n = 387) and 9 years (n = 468). Assessment included PTSD symptomatology (i.e., intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal), anxiety, somatization, and depression. Profile categorization aimed to underscore variations in symptom clustering and severity, and determine whether or not a profile is dominated by PTSD symptoms. Latent Profile analyses (LPA) of sample I revealed four distinct symptoms profiles: (1) ‘symptomatically resilient’; (2) ‘symptomatically low-moderate’; (3) ‘symptomatically moderate-high’; and (4) ‘symptomatically overall high’. LPA of sample II revealed three distinct symptoms profiles: (1) ‘symptomatically resilient’; (2) ‘symptomatically low-moderate’; (3) “symptomatically moderate-high”. Moreover, profile variation was implicated in dysfunction. Consistent with studies focusing on single trauma exposure, the findings revealed that the most prevalent profile was the symptomatically resilient, indicating that most people exposed to CTS seem to evince a scarce number of psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, reactions to CTS proved broader than the existing PTSD symptomatology. Examining symptom dominance and severity in relation to impairment and dysfunction, and clinical considerations are discussed.",542

While many data concerning PTSD in severely injured patients are available, little is known about this disease in slightly injured patients after road traffic accidents. It is rather assumed that PTSD does not exist after objectively slight injuries. In total, 36 patients (Injury Severity Score < 16) after road traffic accidents were included in this prospective cohort study. Next to demographic and accident-specific data, the PDI (Peritraumatic Distress Inventory: individual experienced distress directly during or immediately after the traumatic event), THQ (Trauma History Questionnaire) and the BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory-II: self-report measurement tool to examine the severity of depression) were assessed immediately after trauma (t0). Six weeks (t1) and 3 months (t2) after trauma the Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R), a screening instrument for PTSD, and the BDI-II were collected. Overall 2 patients showed critical measurement values in IES-R after 6 weeks. A strong correlation between PDI and IES-R at t1 and t2 could be detected (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant correlation of BDI-II and IES-R after 6 weeks and 3 months was found (p < 0.05). Neither age or sex showed a significant correlation to IES-R (p ≥ 0.05). The present study showed that symptoms of PTSD can also occur after minor trauma. Especially high peritraumatic distress is associated with developing a PTSD. The occurrence of PTSD should be considered not only in severely injured patients, but also in slightly injured patients after road traffic accidents.",543

However, subjective self-reported symptom measures are the most common outcome indices utilized in PTSD treatment trials and clinic settings. We examined physiological reactivity during a short trauma imagery task as an objective index of response to PTSD treatment, optimized for use in routine clinical care settings.Participants were 35 male combat veterans receiving prolonged exposure (PE) therapy in a Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic. In addition to traditional subjective self-reported and clinician-rated symptom measures, patients also completed a script-driven imagery task in which heart rate (HR) and skin conductance (SC) were recorded at three assessment points across treatment. We examined changes in subjective symptom measures and objective trauma-specific physiological reactivity over the course of PE, and investigated the association between pretreatment physiological reactivity and treatment response.Patients who completed PE showed significantly diminished HR and SC reactivity to trauma imagery across therapy. Additionally, individuals showing greater trauma-specific HR reactivity at pretreatment showed greater reductions in subjectively reported PTSD symptoms at posttreatment.Findings support the utility of physiological reactivity during trauma imagery as an objective outcome measure that has the potential to be incorporated into evidence-based PTSD treatment in routine clinical settings, or prospective studies related to the individualization of care at pretreatment.",544

On the day of transfer to the hospital ward, ICU patients reported pain and state-anxiety levels, as well as ICU and prehospital sleep quality. Two months after hospital discharge, they reported sleep quality at home and experiences in ICU. Six months after hospital discharge, sleep quality, PTS symptoms (measured with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Specific; PCL-S; VA National Center for PTSD, 2014) and psychological well-being (using Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21; DASS-21; Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1994) were reported. Descriptive data analyses were performed and factors associated with PTS symptoms were explored with multiple linear regression.The sample was predominately male (65%), with a mean age 57 years. At baseline, pain intensity was low (M ± SD; 2.25 ± 1.14) and state-anxiety levels were moderate (2.50 ± 2.90). At 6 months, 30% of the sample demonstrated depression, and 13.5% (mean PCL-S score: 26.54 ± 10.52) reported symptoms reflective of PTS. The regression model explained 68.2% of the variance in the PCL-S score. Higher PTS scores were independently associated with frightening experiences in ICU, higher stress and depression scores, pain intensity at baseline, and sleep quality at 6 months.Continuing symptoms of PTS were evident in 14% of the cohort. Screening for prevention and treatment of delirium while a patient is in ICU is essential, and psychological screening and follow-up during recovery would therefore also be beneficial for many patients.

A parallel‐process latent growth model,"Using a parallel-process latent growth model (LGM), this study examined whether posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are associated with the trajectory of sleep disturbance (SD) and fatigue and whether the SD trajectory mediates the PTSS-fatigue relationship.Data were from 215 patients with breast cancer recruited from a tertiary hospital in South Korea. A self-report survey was administered at four time points during the course of adjuvant chemotherapy.The mean age of the participants was 46.69 (SD = 9.08) and the majority was at stage I and the average months since diagnosis was 1.33 (SD = 1.43). Unconditional parallel-process LGM indicated that SD and fatigue were positively associated with each other, both in terms of initial status and growth rate. Then, the conditional parallel-process LGM with baseline PTSS (i.e., avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal) as predictors were examined and anxiety, depressive symptoms and chronotype were entered as covariates in the model. Results indicated that a higher initial status and faster growth of SD were associated with a faster increase in fatigue. Greater baseline hyperarousal was directly related to a higher initial status and a slower increase in SD, and higher initial fatigue. Furthermore, a higher hyperarousal was associated with a greater initial SD, which was related to a faster increase in fatigue. Additionally, the late chronotype was related to a faster increase in fatigue through its impact on the initial SD.The detrimental impact of hyperarousal on the SD trajectory and fatigue suggests the need to intervene in PTSS and SD early and throughout the course of cancer treatments to prevent fatigue.",546

In this study, we examined whether SAM was able to accurately identify posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in adults. Eighty‐nine referred police officers completed SAM, containing the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)‐5 (PCL‐5) and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS‐21), on their own device prior to a diagnostic interview where the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale for DSM‐5 (CAPS‐5) and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV (SCID‐I/P) were administered. Results showed a substantial agreement between SAM and the diagnostic interview in the assessment of PTSD and depression. An optimal trade‐off between sensitivity (89%) and specificity (68%) levels was found at a cut‐off score of 31 on the PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5 (area under the curve = 0.845, 95% CI [0.765, 0.925], diagnostic odds ratio = 15.97). This is one of the first studies to support the validity and reliability of a mobile screener following trauma. SAM may facilitate screening for trauma‐related symptoms on a large scale and could be a first step in a stepped‐care model for trauma survivors to help identify individuals who need further diagnostics and care.",547

In Study 1, we evaluated the factorial structure of the scale comparing the different models existing in the literature in Brazilian samples who responded to the instrument during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Study 2, we provide support for a five-factor model throughout convergent validity with psychological distress and sleep problems, and criterion validity between people with diagnostic of mental disorders. Finally, we evaluated the LMI over a 6-month interval. The results indicated that the five-factor model has excellent goodness of fit and holds strict longitudinal invariance.

Method The optimal symptom indicators of PTSD and CPTSD were identified by applying item response theory ( IRT ) analysis to data from a trauma‐exposed community sample ( n = 1051) and a trauma‐exposed clinical sample ( n = 247) from the United Kingdom. The validity of the optimized 12‐item ITQ was assessed with confirmatory factor analyses. Diagnostic rates were estimated and compared to previous validation studies. Results The latent structure of the 12‐item, optimized ITQ was consistent with prior findings, and diagnostic rates of PTSD and CPTSD were in line with previous estimates. Conclusion The ITQ is a brief, simply worded measure of the core features of PTSD and CPTSD . It is consistent with the organizing principles of the ICD ‐11 to maximize clinical utility and international applicability through a focus on a limited but central set of symptoms.

Less is known about risk for PTSD in patients who rule out for ACS. Our objective was to compare the risk of developing PTSD among patients who rule out versus rule in for ACS. We enrolled a consecutive sample of 1000 patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) with symptoms of a probable ACS. We assessed presenting ACS symptoms in the ED. We determined whether presenting symptoms were due to a confirmed ACS or another etiology by chart review. We assessed PTSD by telephone 1 month after discharge using the PTSD Checklist specific for the suspected ACS event (PCL-S). We used logistic regression to determine the association of ruling out versus ruling in for ACS with a positive PTSD screen (PCL-S ≥ 32), adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, depression, trauma history, and pre-existing PTSD. Approximately two-thirds of patients (68.2%) ruled out for ACS. Compared to confirmed ACS patients, patients who ruled out had similar presenting symptoms, and similar risk of screening positive for PTSD (18.9% versus 16.8%; p = 0.47; adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.69–2.00; p = 0.55). ED presentation with ACS symptoms was sufficient to trigger a positive PTSD screen whether the etiology was due to a life-threatening ACS or another etiology.

How trauma centrality in identity formation and interoceptive awareness modify trauma-related cognitive and somatic disturbances has not been studied. This study proposed that trauma centrality and interoceptive awareness predicted PTSD symptomology while controlling for the type and number of traumas. Using convenient sampling, this study recruited 554 participants residing in Lebanon for the past 3 years to complete an online survey. The study used four instruments: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), Centrality of Events Scale (CES), The Trauma History Screen (THS), and Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Version 2 (MAIA-2). Hierarchical regression was conducting using SPSS to analyze the data. When controlling for the number and type of traumas, trauma centrality was shown to be positive significant predictor of PTSD symptomology while interoceptive awareness was shown to be negative significant predictor of PTSD symptomology. These findings suggest that trauma centrality in post-traumatic identity formation and interoceptive awareness may be key targets in the treatment of patients with PTSD and the clinicians’ focus may shift from traumatic event narration to investigating the effect of the traumatic experiences on cognition and somatic experience",551

The Texas-Childhood Trauma Research Network (TX-CTRN) is a multi-site collaboration that addresses these limitations. In this baseline-only report, we examined domains of trauma and evaluated the concurrent predictive validity of various traumatic event scoring schemas for clinical diagnoses. Broad-base recruitment of 8–20 year-olds (N = 1289) included trauma centers, emergency departments, pediatric and primary care clinics, and other community settings. Assessments were comprehensive and based on clinical interviews by trained research interviewers. Factor analyses supported a five-factor solution of trauma domains including unintentional/acute, intentional/interpersonal, bullying, in-home versus community witnessed interpersonal harms. Trauma burden scoring schemas were examined for their predictive superiority. Domain-specific counts of traumas that met DSM-5 post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD) Criterion-A was the best overall schema in distinguishing among youth with no diagnosis, comorbidities, those with depression, suicidality, substance misuse, and PTSD. There were no assessments of neglect. Findings largely aligned with earlier studies on the relative importance of intentional interpersonal traumas and showed bullying may be an important source of traumatic stress that independently adds to prediction of several diagnoses and should be considered in clinical practice.",554

Since parents’ mental health issues have been shown to increase the risk of problems in the child’s development, it is important to identify the risk factors for developing mental health issues in parents, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In women, severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) has been shown to be a risk factor for developing PTSD. Therefore, our objective was to identify whether witnessing severe PPH is a risk factor for developing PTSD in partners. In this prospective cohort study, we compared two groups of participants; partners of women with severe PPH (≥2000 mL, PPH partners) and partners of women with ≤500 mL of blood loss (control partners). Participants were screened for PTSD and PTSD symptoms four to six weeks after delivery, using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Positive screening was followed by the Clinical Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) to diagnose PTSD. We included 123 PPH partners (blood loss 2500 mL, 2000-3000 mL (median, IQR)) and 62 control partners (blood loss 300 mL. 200-350 mL). According to the PCL-5, more PPH partners met the criteria for a provisional diagnosis of PTSD compared to control partners (n=7, 5.7% vs n=0, 0.0%; p=.10). This finding was, however, not statistically significant. Based on the CAPS-5 there were no participants in both groups diagnosed with PTSD. In this study, women averagely scored higher than their partners on the PCL-5, but there was no relation in scores within dyads. Table: All variables are shown in n (%), mean ± SD or median (25-75%).

Seventy-one individuals were randomly assigned to PE or person-centered therapy (PCT). Outcome measures were administered at baseline and sessions 3, 6, 9, and 12. Mixed modeling was used to regress outcome measures on time, treatment group, and number of visits. Individuals who received PE showed significant moderate association with decline in reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as noted by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 ( p = 0.05) compared with PCT. Results indicated improved scores on all measures at each follow-up time point compared with baseline ( p ≤ 0.01). PE was feasible, shown by positive recruitment and ability of clinicians to effectively implement and maintain treatment fidelity. Findings suggest that PE can be effective for treating complex trauma when used by clinicians in community settings.",557

The current study aims to inspect the factorial validity and cross-linguistic equivalence of the PCL-5 in individuals after TBI with differential severity. Data for six language groups ( n ≥ 200; Dutch, English, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish) were extracted from the CENTER-TBI study database. Factorial validity of PTSD was evaluated using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), and compared between four concurrent structural models. A multi-group CFA approach was utilized to investigate the measurement invariance (MI) of the PCL-5 across languages. All structural models showed satisfactory goodness-of-fit with small between-model variation. The original DSM-5 model for PTSD provided solid evidence of MI across the language groups. The current study underlines the validity of the clinical DSM-5 conceptualization of PTSD and demonstrates the comparability of PCL-5 symptom scores between language versions in individuals after TBI. Future studies should apply MI methods to other sociodemographic (e.g., age, gender) and injury-related (e.g., TBI severity) characteristics to improve the monitoring and clinical care of individuals suffering from PTSD symptoms after TBI.",558

While having a caesarean section (C-section) is known to be a significant risk factor for postpartum PTSD, it is currently unknown whether coexisting anaesthesia-related factors are also associated to the disorder. The aim of this study was to assess anaesthesia-linked factors in the development of acute postpartum PTSD.We performed a prospective cohort study on women having a C-section in a tertiary hospital in Switzerland. Patients were followed up six weeks postpartum. Patient and procedure characteristics, past morbidity or traumatic events, psychosocial status and stressful perinatal events were measured. Outcome was divided into two categories: full PTSD disease and PTSD profile. This was based on the number of DSM-IV criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) present. The PTSD Checklist Scale and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale were used for measurement.Of the 280 patients included, 217 (77.5%) answered the questionnaires and 175 (62.5%) answered to an additional phone interview. Twenty (9.2%) had a PTSD profile and six (2.7%) a PTSD. When a full predictive model of risk factors for PTSD profile was built using logistic regression, maternal prepartum and intrapartum complications, anaesthetic complications and dissociative experiences during C-section were found to be the significant predictors for PTSD profile.This is the first study to show in parturients having a C-section that an anaesthesia complication is an independent risk factor for postpartum PTSD and PTSD profile development, in addition to known perinatal and maternal risk factors.",559

One promising solution is delivering the evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) three or more times per week within an intensive outpatient program (IOP) for PTSD. The present study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a relatively low-resourced PTSD IOP within a larger PTSD program at the Veterans Healthcare Administration. The intensive program offers two tracks (2 week or 4 week) grounded in the massed delivery of PE and CPT. Over a 12-month period, 351 veterans completed an assessment for PTSD and 172 started within one of the local PTSD programs (e.g., weekly, IOP, or residential). Results of the study demonstrated that the IOP is an acceptable (i.e., 87.3% completion rate) and effective (e.g., PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM-5] [PCL-5] decrease effect size d = 1.80) treatment option. There was also adequate demand for the program (e.g., 37.2% of patients engaged in care with the PTSD programs started the IOP), and the program was implemented with fidelity to the design. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that this low-resource IOP model is a promising approach to improve completion rates within the continuum of care for the treatment of PTSD.

Most alarming, PTSD occurs at double the rate for combat veterans compared to the general population. Severity of PTSD is associated with risk taking behaviors such as substance abuse, non-suicidal self-injury, sexual risk behaviors, among other negative behaviors. Psychological disorders are often preceded by crisis events, thus monitoring for crisis events can help prevent risky behavior in veterans. Ecological momentary assessment techniques are effective in capturing possible crisis events for veterans. Mobile apps are commonly used to gather such behavioral changes in participants. Crisis events collected from m-health can be analyzed for the identification of long- term PTSD risk. Early identification of risk can help in planning intervention to mitigate the risk. Many scholars have used traditional statistical and machine learning methods for the prediction of mental health issues in individuals. But these models lack transparency in how decisions are made. Providing justifications for the predictions can increase the reliability of the model. Our research focused on developing an explainable prediction model using class association rules to identify veterans at risk of persistent PTSD. The generated association rules serve as precursors to the long-term crisis in veterans. Results of the analysis showed that having no family support, little or no interest in hobbies, stress and lack of sleep are some of the influencing factors of persistent PTSD in veterans.",561

To identify the effects of social support and impact of event on posttraumatic growth of patients after percutaneous coronary intervention, and to provided basis for individualized interventions.


Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 337 patients after percutaneous coronary intervention. The instruments included the social support rating Scale(SSRS), impact of event scale-revised (IES-R), the posttraumatic growth inventory(PTGI).


Results
The patients′ PTG level was 57.16±14.96, the total score of Impact of Event Scale-Revised was (31.83±12.94),and the total score of Social support was 3(9.17±9.70). Social support was positively correlated with posttraumatic growth, whereas impact of event was negatively correlated with posttraumatic growth (P<0.05) . Structural equation modeling analysis showed that impact of event directly negative effect PTG and social support, and indirectly affected PTG through social support.


Conclusions
The level of posttraumatic growth of patients after percutaneous coronary intervention was medium, and the posttraumatic stress symptoms was serious, while the patients′ have acquired social support was better. Clinical medical works should give more social support to patients in order to improve the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention and relieve symptoms of post-traumatic stress, so as to promote the posttraumatic growth of patient with coronary heart disease.

A previous study showed that CSE affects subsequent PTSS levels, but not vice versa among a sample exposed 0–6 months ago. In this four-wave follow-up study we examined the cross-lagged relationships between CSE and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among those exposed to PTEs (potentially traumatic events) 1–2 years before T1 in order to examine direction of influence. Research questions were: 1) what are the cross-lagged associations between CSE and PTSS levels among those exposed to PTE in the relatively long-term (1–2 years ago, called PTE long-term group), and 2) to what extent do these associations differ from the cross lagged associations among those exposed to PTE in the relatively short-term (0–6 months ago)? Study samples consist of adult respondents of a representative internet panel who experienced a PTE between 1 and 2 years before T1, and did not experience any new PTE between T1 and T3 (long-term group, N = 438) and those exposed in the six months before T1, and not exposed to any additional PTE (short-term group, N = 400). Levels of CSE and PTSS were measured with 4-month intervals. In addition, prospectively assessed personality traits and peritraumatic distress were entered in the analyses. Structural equation modeling showed that CSE perceptions will continue to influence subsequent PTSS levels in the long-term, just as they did in the short-term. Contrary to the more short-term post-exposure period however, CSE levels do not just influence recovery from PTSS. Over time, degree of PTSS experienced also influences subsequent CSE perceptions. Results suggest that while trauma-related CSE perceptions are relatively robust in the short-term recovery period, they can be affected by posttraumatic stress in the long-term.",563

It is very frequent in childhood and untreated traumatic stress symptoms in children and adolescents often result in debilitating consequences on development with increased risks for a variety of physical and mental disorders. Ιt has been found that PTSD symptoms are reduced as soon as therapeutic interventions have been applied. The aim of the present review was to summarize the available literature regarding aggravating factors associated with the development of PTSD in children after hospitalization and assessment tools for a quick and reliable screening of children who are at risk for developing PTSD. A review of published papers was conducted until April 10, 2019 to identify articles that discuss the aggravating factors and the assessment tools for PTSD in children after hospitalization published in English, German or Greek language. Search was performed on PubMed with the following combination of key-words: ""PTSD"" and ""children"" and ""hospitalization"", using the filters ''human'' and ""Publication date from 30/11/2007 to 09/04/2019"" and choosing ""all fields'' in PubMed Advanced Search Builder. Of the 115 articles reviewed, 16 relevant articles were included, 10 of them referred to the aggravating factors and the remaining 6 were related to the assessment tools. Significant aggravating factors associated with the development of PTSD were: traumatic injuries and illness/ medical-related hospital admission, previous health problems, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) hospitalization, attendance at a hospital for child and adolescent psychiatry, female gender and psychotherapy and initial high Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) in parents. As for assessment tools, it was observed that the Child Trauma Screening Questionnaire (CTSQ)-Heart Rate (HR), the alternative PTSD algorithm (PTSD-AA), the Child Stress Disorders Checklist-Short Form (CSDC-SF), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) model for PTSD symptom categories, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Semi-Structured Interview (PTSDSSI), the Preschool Children's Assessment of Stress Scale (PCASS) and the diagnostic interview for children and adolescents (DICA-P) led to the identification of children who were likely to develope or had already developed PTSD symptoms, in the study population wherein each was implemented. The greatest limitation - but also a significant finding - of this review is the scarceness of published studies on this topic. Overall, there is a variety of aggravating factors associated with the development of PTSD in children after hospitalization. Assessment tools should be able to identify immediately the children who are likely to or have already developed PTSD symptoms.",564

The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is often used as a self-report instrument for symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS). The objective of this study was to explore the reliability and validity of the Lithuanian IES-R in a sample of employees with exposure to workplace bullying in different occupations. Materials and methods. The original IES-R was translated into Lithuanian, and the comparability of content was verified through back-translation procedures. 294 employees with exposure to workplace bullying (52 teachers from the secondary schools of Kaunas, 56 family physicians, 101 nurses of internal medicine departments, 40 waiters, and 45 seafarers) were administered the Lithuanian IES-R and the General Health Questionnaire – 12 (GHQ-12) in order to verify some aspects of convergent validity. The exploratory factor analysis was used to verify the construct validity of the IES-R. Results. The reliability of the Lithuanian version of the IES-R was verified. Cronbach’s α of the total scale was 0.95. Exploratory factor analysis showed a clear factor structure with three independent dimensions: intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal. Cronbach’s α for subscales of intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal were 0.89, 0.85, and 0.88, respectively. The convergent validity was supported by positive correlations between the subscales (intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal) and the GHQ-12. Conclusions. The results suggest that the self-reported Lithuanian IES-R is a valid instrument for assessing the dimensions of post-traumatic stress, has good psychometric properties, and may be applied in prolonged trauma-exposed populations.",565

Today, traumatic events and PTSD are viewed as worldwide phenomena that are prevalent and cross all subgroups of the population. This chapter focuses on the assessment of PTSD. It begins with a review of the nature of the disorder, which is followed by a review of clinical assessment instruments designed for the assessment purposes of (a) diagnosis, (b) case conceptualization and treatment planning, and (c) treatment monitoring and evaluation.

Methods: The total sample was composed of 99 Brazilian college students, but only 37 participants fulfilled DSM-IV criterion A for PTSD diagnosis. The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist – Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Brief COPE were used to assess the participants’ PTSS and use of coping styles, respectively. Correlation analysis and subsequent regressions were conducted between coping strategies and PTSS through traditional and Bayesian approaches. Results: Bayesian and frequentist correlations showed that emotion-focused and problem-focused coping styles were associated with reduced PTSS, while dysfunctional coping style was positively related to PTSS severity. In the subsequent linear regression, the best model predicting PTSS severity was composed by emotion-focused coping and dysfunctional coping, with the former predicting less symptoms and latter predicting more symptoms. However, in the Bayesian regression approach the dysfunctional coping cluster was the most robust in predicting posttraumatic stress symptoms severity. Conclusions: reduced use of adaptive coping (emotion-focused) and more use of dysfunctional coping styles are related to higher PTSS. According to the Bayesian approach, which permits more generalization of data, dysfunctional coping style is determinant in the prediction of high levels of PTSS. Considering the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) continuum, the present findings add new data to the body of research that highlight the critical role of distinct coping strategies in the severity of PTSS. The comprehension of which coping strategies are used and their outcome can enhance the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in this mental disorder",567

Using a multisite, longitudinal study, participants with a traumatic physical injury (N = 1,098) were assessed during hospital admission and followed up at 3 months (N = 932, 86%) and at 12 months (N = 715, 71%). Injury site was measured using the Abbreviated Injury Scale 90, and objective injury severity was measured using the Injury Severity Score. Participants also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Clinician Administered Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale. A random intercept mixed modelling analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of site and severity of injury in relation to anxiety, PTSD, and depressive symptoms. Injury severity, as well as head and facial injuries, was predictive of elevated PTSD symptoms, and external injuries were associated with both PTSD and depression severity. In contrast, lower extremity injuries were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. The findings suggest that visible injuries are predictive of reduced mental health, particularly PTSD following traumatic injury. This has clinical implications for further advancing the screening for vulnerable injured trauma survivors at risk of chronic psychopathology.",569

We aimed to investigate the longitudinal association between symptoms of complicated grief and PTSD in a bereaved trauma-exposed sample.In total, 275 bereaved survivors (M age = 19.3, SD = 4.6 years; 47.3% females) of the 2011 massacre on Utøya Island, Norway, participated in semistructured interviews 4-5 months (Time 1 [T1]), 14-15 months (Time 2 [T2]), and 30-32 months (Time 3 [T3]) posttrauma. Complicated grief was measured using the Brief Grief Questionnaire, and posttraumatic stress reactions using the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index. To explore associations between symptoms of complicated grief and PTSD over time, we used a random intercepts cross-lagged panel model.The participants had lost a close friend (n = 256) and/or a family member/partner (n = 19) in the attack. We found a strong correlation between stable individual differences in symptoms of complicated grief and PTSD across the three time-points. PTSD symptoms at T2 predicted complicated grief reactions at T3, but not vice versa.Findings suggest that targeting PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed bereaved may hinder later development of complicated grief.

https://openalex.org/W2413329347,,P4: Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) After a Car Accident,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common response to traumatic events. A cognitive model proposed that PTSD becomes chronic when individuals process the trauma in a way that leads to a sense of serious, current threat. The sense of threat arises as an outcome of excessively negative appraisals of the trauma and its sequel and a disturbance of autobiographical memory. Variations in the negative evaluations and the trauma memory are prevented by a series of problematic behavioral and cognitive strategies. The aim of present study is to examine the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention following physical injury. A purposive sample of twenty volunteer participants who had car accidents were randomly assigned to experimental (n=10) and control group (n=10). All subjects were assessed using questionnaires designed to establish basic demographic information, levels of functioning and perceptions of the trauma and its impact. The Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) were also completed. Experimental group received eight sessions of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), included education about post-trauma reactions, relaxation training, exposure therapy with cognitive restructuring and instruction for self-directed graduated behavior practice. Pre-assessment was carried for both the group at the beginning of the intervention. Post-assessment was done for both the groups after completing CBT intervention. Third assessment was following up assessment that was done after post-assessment. As predicted by the cognitive model, useful treatment outcome was related to greater changes in dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions. Some characteristics such as type of trauma, history of previous trauma, or time since the traumatic event was occurred were predicted treatment response. Furthermore, Type of Personality, level of educational and level of socioeconomic status were related to better outcome.

Little is known about the relationship between response inhibition abnormalities and distinct PTSD symptom clusters. This study investigated the relationship between response inhibition processing and a five-factor model of posttraumatic stress symptomatology in adolescents. The event-related potentials of 54 unmedicated adolescent earthquake survivors (age 15-18 years) were recorded as they completed a Go/NoGo task. The PTSD Checklist-Specific Stressor Version (PCL-S) was used to assess PTSD symptoms. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between the five symptom-cluster model and response inhibition processing. The results revealed that the avoidance symptom cluster score, but not the numbing or other clusters' scores, was positively associated with NoGo-P3 latency.

Participants were evaluated using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale before treatment and were reassessed using the CAPS after treatment and at 6-month follow-up. A total of 69 patients underwent an average of 4 sessions of EMDR, and 60 (87%) completed the posttreatment evaluation, including 8 participants who terminated treatment prematurely. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed that 39 (65%) of the 60 patients were classified as responders and 21 (35%) as nonresponders when response was defined as more than a 30% decrease in total CAPS score. The nonresponders had higher levels of dissociation (depersonalization and derealization) and numbing symptoms, but other PTSD symptoms, such as avoidance, hyperarousal, and intrusion, were not significantly different. The number of psychiatric comorbidities was also associated with treatment nonresponse. The final logistic regression model yielded 2 significant variables: dissociation (p < .001) and more than 2 comorbidities compared to none (p < .05).

We compared psychophysiological changes, session-by-session, between VRE and traditional imaginal exposure. Methods Heart rate (HR), galvanic skin response (GSR), and peripheral skin temperature were collected every 5 min during exposure sessions with 61 combat veterans of Iraq/Afghanistan and compared to the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) outcomes using multilevel modeling. Results Over the course of treatment, participants in the PE group had higher HR arousal compared to participants in the VRE group. With reference to GSR, in earlier sessions, participants demonstrated a within-session increase, whereas, in later sessions, participants showed a within-session habituation response. A significant interaction was found for GSR and treatment assignment for within-session change, within-person effect, predicting CAPS (d = 0.70) and PCL-C (d = 0.66) outcomes. Conclusion Overall, these findings suggest that exposure to traumatic memories activates arousal across sessions, with GSR being most associated with reductions in PTSD symptoms for participants in the PE group.",576

In the qualitative synthesis, 10 studies were included which showed interesting results in the improvement of PTSD symptoms and other variables. In conclusion, EAS are beneficial for post-traumatic symptoms in the short term follow-up period. However, EAS require further research and major standardization.",577

In this retrospective analysis of cytokine levels following severe burn injury in children, we tested the hypothesis that patients who screen positive for PTSD on self-report measures had a significantly different maximum recorded cytokine level in the first 30 days following injury than those who do not develop PTSD. Patients from our center who completed either the PTSD Checklist - Civilian (PCLC) and/or the Childhood PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) as part of their participation in the Burn Model System longitudinal study were included. Patients 18 years and older were administered the PCLC while those patients 8–17 years old were given the CPSS. Each patient’s highest recorded cytokine level in the 30 days following injury was used for analysis; a Box-Cox transformation was applied due to the non-normality of the data and the groups were compared using t-tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact tests on categorical data. A multivariate logistic regression model was then created, using age at burn, gender, TBSA, inhalation injury, days on ventilator, cytokine levels and days between burn and admission as covariates. A total of 137 patients were included, with 116 (85%) screening negative for PTSD and 21 (15%) screening positive. No significant differences were found between the groups for demographic data or cytokine levels, with the exception of transformed IL-6 levels (16.9 ± 11.8 versus 12.1 ± 7.7, p=0.03). In multivariate modeling, only IL-6 and inhalation injury were found to have statistically significant associations with PTSD (p=0.02 and p=0.01). Decreased pro-inflammatory signaling in the acute phase following burn injury is associated with the subsequent development of PTSD in severely burned children, providing further evidence that disruptions in immune function play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. PTSD is a debilitating consequence of burn injury and treatment. This project contributes to the increasing body of work delineating the role of immune system dysfunction in PTSD.",579

Available data from studies on convenient samples show very high rates of probable PTSD compared with relevant estimates in other countries. Objective This study aimed to measure the exposure to self-report traumatic events (PTEs) and to estimate the current rate of prevalence of probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in accordance with DSM–5 criteria in a population-based sample of Poles. Additionally, the link between PTSD intensity and level of life satisfaction was investigated. Method A representative sample of 1,598 adult Poles was recruited. Probable PTSD was assessed with the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM–5 (PDS–5) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) was also used. Results The findings showed that 60.3% of Poles had experienced at least one PTE and 31.1% of those who had been exposed to trauma reported symptoms of PTSD. At the level of the entire sample, the obtained rate for probable PTSD was 18.8%. The traumatic events with the highest probabilities of PTSD symptoms were child abuse and sexual assault. Levels of life satisfaction were significantly lower in the group of participants with probable PTSD. Conclusions We found that the current prevalence of probable PTSD in Poland is intriguingly high relative to rates reported in comparable representative samples from other countries across the world. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including a lack of social acknowledgement of WWII and other traumas as well as poor access to trauma-focused care. We hope that this research may inspire more studies investigating cross-national differences in PTSD and trauma exposure.",581

In one questionnaire study, 51% of the patients with epilepsy were reported to have a PTSD caused by a traumatic seizure, termed postepileptic seizure PTSD by the authors. However, it remained unclear whether these patients had further psychiatric comorbidities and if certain seizure features may foster the development of the proposed epilepsy-specific PTSD. Methods We conducted a structured clinical interview assessing psychiatric disorders in 120 patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsies. We also used a modified version of the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale conducted as an interview to assess the number of patients who fulfilled the criteria for a PTSD caused by an epileptic seizure. We additionally compared certain features of traumatic versus nontraumatic seizures. Results Fifty of the 120 patients identified a seizure that fulfilled the criteria for a traumatic event, whereas 28 patients identified a worst seizure not meeting the trauma definition. Six patients fulfilled all PTSD criteria caused by a traumatic seizure. However, three of these patients also had a regular PTSD, and in two further patients, the results of the clinical interview suggested that the PTSD-like symptoms could be better explained by an adjustment disorder. We could not identify seizure characteristics differentiating traumatic from nontraumatic seizures. Conclusion Our results showed that it is recommendable to conceptualize an epileptic seizure as being potentially traumatic in nature when assessing PTSD in patients with epilepsy, although we could not identify specific characteristics that could differentiate between traumatic and nontraumatic seizures. However, while using interview-based psychiatric assessment, we found a very low rate of a postepileptic seizure PTSD. It is worth conducting a comprehensive psychiatric diagnostic interview to differentiate PTSD-like symptoms from other comorbidities, such as epilepsy-related adjustment disorder.",582

The abilities of 2 testing procedures, curtailment and stochastic curtailment, to lessen the instrument's mean test length while maintaining the same result as the full-length PCL-5 (""positive"" or ""negative"") were evaluated in a post hoc simulation. Curtailment and stochastic curtailment track a respondent's answers as she takes the instrument and stop the test if future items are unable or unlikely to change the result. The performance of each procedure was recorded under 2 scoring methods: a total-score-based method and a cluster-based method. Each procedure's sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement with the full-length PCL-5 were computed.Curtailment reduced the mean test length by 40% under the total-score-based method, and by more than 70% under the cluster-based method, while exhibiting 100% sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement with the full-length PCL-5. Stochastic curtailment reduced the mean test length by up to 88% under the total-score-based method, and up to 84% under the cluster-based method, while always exhibiting at least 92% sensitivity and 99.8% overall agreement, as well as 100% specificity, for the full-length PCL-5.Curtailment and stochastic curtailment have potential to enhance the efficiency of the PCL-5 when this assessment is administered by computer.

The present study examines the frequency of PTEs in children and adolescents with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the type of index trauma, and its relation to PTSD symptom severity and gender. A clinical sample of 159 children and adolescents between 7-16 years was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents (CAPS-CA). All reported PTEs from the checklist were analyzed according to frequency. The index events were categorized according to the following categories: cause (random vs. intentional), relation to offender (intrafamilial vs. extrafamilial), patient's role (victim, witness or vicarious traumatization), and type of PTE (physical or sexual violence). Relation between categories and PTSD symptom severity and sex were analyzed with inferential statistics. On average participants reported five PTEs, most frequently physical violence without weapons (57.9%), loss of loved person through death (45.9%), and sexual abuse/assaults (44%). The most frequent index traumata were intentional (76.7%). Regarding trauma type, there was a significant difference concerning higher symptom severity in children and adolescents who experienced sexual abuse/assault compared to physical violence (t=-1.913(109), p=0.05). A significantly higher symptom severity was found for girls compared to boys for the trauma categories extrafamilial offender (z=-2,27, p=0.02), victim (z=-2,11, p=0,04), and sexual abuse/assault (z=-2,43, p=0,01).

The SPTS-12 is a reliable and valid scale with a one-factor structure. The aim of the present study is to further examine the psychometric properties of the SPTS-12 by evaluating its criterion validity and how scores change over time in a sample of postsurgical patients at the Toronto General Hospital Transitional Pain Service.361 adults (55% male; Mage = 50.6 years, SDage = 14.3) completed questionnaires assessing symptoms of pain, anxiety, depression, and trauma at multiple visits to the Transitional Pain Service after surgery. Latent-class growth mixture modeling defined prototypical longitudinal patterns (latent trajectories) of SPTS-12 scores up to two years after surgery. One-way ANOVAs examined how trajectory classes differed over time on measures of daily opioid use (mg morphine equivalents (MME)), average pain intensity, pain interference, and depressive symptoms.The final model consisted of five SPTS-12 trajectory groups; two characterized by a flat and unchanging pattern and three showing a small but statistically significant decrease over time. Analysis of pain-related outcomes predicted by SPTS-12 trajectories provided evidence of criterion validity of the SPTS-12. SPTS-12 trajectories did not significantly differ on daily MME at any time. Average pain, pain interference, and depression scores significantly differed across SPTS-12 trajectory groups at two or more postsurgical visits (all p < 0.05).The SPTS-12 shows fairly stable patterns and predicts important pain-related and psychosocial outcomes over time. Two SPTS-12 trajectories (#2 and #5) with high scores, comprising ~28% of the total sample, are associated with problematic outcomes on several pain and psychosocial measures. Targeting patients with high SPTS-12 scores for presurgical psychological treatment may prove beneficial in reducing the impact of CPSP.",587

In line with the DSM–5 changes, an updated version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS–5) was released. The CAPS–5 is considered to be the gold-standard measure of PTSD; however, examinations of the psychometric properties and optimal factor structure of this scale are underrepresented in PTSD studies. Methods: This study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the factor structure of the CAPS–5 using a sample of 267 male Australian Vietnam Veterans. Models drawn from the PTSD CFA literature were used to test the underlying dimensions of PTSD: the four-factor DSM–5 model, six-factor externalizing behaviour and anhedonia models, and seven-factor hybrid model. Results: The results found that the DSM–5 model showed slightly less than adequate fit (comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.90, Tucker–Lewis index [TLI] = 0.88, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.064), however, other models showed acceptable fit. The anhedonia model provided a significantly better fit than the other models (CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.059). Discussion: Overall, the results supported the anhedonia model. This result may indicate that the underlying dimensions of PTSD in Australian Vietnam Veterans may best be represented by six distinct factors.",588

Their repeat length shortens with cell division acting as a biomarker of cellular aging. Traumatic stress events during adulthood or childhood have been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and short leukocyte telomere length (LTL). This study investigated whether LTL was associated with PTSD in a Brazilian sample of sexually assaulted civilian women at two time points: baseline and 1-year follow-up. At baseline, we assessed 64 women with PTSD following sexual assault (cases) and 60 women with no previous history of sexual trauma or mental disorders (healthy controls - HC). At follow-up visit, 13 persistent PTSD cases, 11 HCs, and 11 PTSD remitters patients were evaluated. PTSD diagnosis and severity were assessed using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III/IV criteria) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), respectively. LTL was measured using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the baseline analysis, we observed that LTL was associated with re-experiencing symptoms (B = -0.16; confidence interval (CI) 95% = -0.027--0.005; Bonferroni-adjusted p-value = 0.02), but no association was observed between other PTSD symptoms and LTL. In the longitudinal analysis, telomere shortening was no longer observed in patients with PTSD and PTSD remitters. In conclusion, our findings indicate that shorter baseline LTL is associated with early stage of PTSD re-experiencing symptoms in recently sexually assaulted women.",589

This study extends the group literature by improving methodology in examining the efficacy of a 3-module (cognitive, exposure, skills) group treatment for PTSD, establishes a format for the delivery of group exposure therapy, and compares 3 treatment modules within the group.Eighty-six Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) women veterans were randomized to a 16-week, 3-member group treatment (Tx) or a waitlist (WL) condition. The primary (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS]) and secondary (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 [SF-36], Quality of Life Inventory [QOLI], and PTSD Checklist [PCL]) outcome measures were administered at baseline, post Tx/WL, and at 3- and 6-months post Tx (PCL additionally at pre/post for each treatment module).PTSD symptoms significantly improved in Tx arm participants (p < .001, ES = 1.72; unit of analysis group: n = 14), as did mental and physical life functioning (SF-36; p < .001), and quality of life (QOLI; p < .001). The WL significantly improved on the SF-36 (mental; p = .04) and QOLI (p = .02). Clinical improvement (CAPS) in the Tx arm reflected a treatment response (≥10-point decrease) in 77% and loss of PTSD diagnosis (<45) in 52% of participants, comparable to individual prolonged exposure (PE) treatment. Finally, PCL scores significantly lowered in exposure and cognitive modules.This study supports the use of group format for PTSD with 3 modules using improved methodology, with a novel, 3-member group which allows repeated in-session weekly imaginal exposures.

However, there is a lack of validated and feasible assessments for assessing traumatic stress symptoms in pediatric primary care, and traumatic stress symptoms are routinely unidentified. This study aimed to develop, pilot test, and assess the psychometric properties of the Adolescent Primary Care Traumatic Stress Screen (APCTSS), a five-item yes/no screener for post-traumatic stress symptoms in adolescents designed for use in pediatric primary care.The APCTSS was developed by pediatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers who all provide care to trauma-affected adolescent patients. The providers sought to create a developmentally appropriate tool that accurately reflected DSM-5 posttraumatic stress symptoms and that was feasible and acceptable for use in pediatric primary care. To develop the APCTSS, they combined and adapted the UCLA Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Reaction Index for DSM-5 with the adult Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5. Next, 213 adolescent medicine patients were universally approached during routine clinic visits and 178 agreed to participate and were enrolled. The 178 patients were aged 13-22 (M=18.4, SD=2.3), 64.4% female; 62.1% Black or African-American, and 20.7% Hispanic/Latinx. Patients completed APCTSS, Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A), and the Child PTSD Symptom Scale for DSM-5 Interview (CPSS-5-I), and 61 completed the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory for Children (TESI-C).56.7% reported a criterion A trauma, 30.1% met criteria for DSM-5 PTSD, 7.4% met criteria for subsyndromal PTSD symptoms, and 19.0% for post-event impairing symptoms. Validity and reliability testing indicated that the APCTSS was internally consistent, had good concurrent and discriminant validity, and demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in identifying adolescents at high risk for post-trauma symptoms. Over half of patients (56.0%) who screened positive on the APCTSS (score ≥2) would not have been identified as having a mental health concern using the PHQ-A, including 60.8% of patients who had probable PTSD, subsyndromal PTSD, or post-event impairing symptoms.Many youth with trauma-related mental health symptoms are unidentified in pediatric primary care, which is a missed opportunity for early identification and may contribute to a host of poor outcomes.

We examined the nature and construct validity (covariates of age, gender, depression severity, number of trauma types, functional impairment) of the optimal class solution categorizing participants based on PTSD symptom and RSDB endorsement. The sample included 417 trauma-exposed individuals recruited through Amazon's MTurk platform who completed the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, the Posttrauma Risky Behaviors Questionnaire, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Latent profile analyses indicated an optimal three-class solution: the Low PTSD-RSDBs, High PTSD-Low RSDBs, and High PTSD-RSDBs classes. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that impairment and depression predicted the High PTSD-Low RSDBs vs. the Low PTSD-RSDBs classes. Impairment, age, being female, and depression predicted the High vs. Low PTSD-RSDBs classes. Number of trauma types, age, being female, and depression predicted the High PTSD-RSDBs vs. High PTSD-Low RSDBs classes. Results support the presence of a reckless behaviors subtype of PTSD (characterized by greater depression, greater impariment, greater number of trauma types, being male, and being younger), conducting comprehensive assessments of RSDBs for individuals reporting PTSD symptoms and of PTSD symptoms for individuals reporting RSDBs, and the need to tailor interventions to treat PTSD and RSDBs concurrently.",592

Surprisingly, the recently developed City Birth Trauma Scale (City BiTS) was the first diagnostic tool for childbirth-related PTSD covering DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Since no questionnaire on childbirth-related PTSD is available in German, we aimed to validate a German translation of the City BiTS and to provide information on its psychometric properties. Methods: A community sample of 1,072 mothers completed an online survey, which included questions on sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, the German version of the City BiTS, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the anxiety subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-Anxiety). Results: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a random split-half sample confirmed the previously reported two-factorial structure of the City BiTS. The factors ""Childbirth-related symptoms"" and ""General symptoms"" explained about 53%, 52% of variance. Internal consistency was good to excellent for the subscales and the total scale (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.89-0.92). In a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the holdout sample the two-factorial solution reached the best model fit out of three models. Correlation analyses showed convergent validity of the City BiTS (total scale and subscales) with the IES-R and PCL-5 and divergent validity with the EPDS and the DASS-Anxiety. Limitations: Data were acquired in a community sample and prevalence rates might not be representative for mothers of high-risk groups, e.g., after preterm birth. Conclusions: The German version of the City BiTS is the first German questionnaire which allows to assess symptoms of childbirth-related PTSD according to DSM-5 criteria. Besides an improvement in clinical routine it will help to make data on prevalence of childbirth-related PTSD internationally comparable. In addition, this work provides a basis to assess childbirth-related PTSD in studies conducted with a longitudinal study design or in high-risk samples.",593

Longitudinal studies exploring PTSS alone or in combination with depression are non-existent for postpartum adolescent populations. This study aimed to identify stress/PTSS and depression symptoms at 72 hours and three, six, and nine months postpartum, and determine if symptoms at each time point predicted later symptoms.MethodsA convenience sample of 303 adolescents 13–19 years of age were recruited from two postpartum units of one, large, public hospital. The Impact of Event Scale and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Inventory provided a screen of symptoms for stress/PTSS and depression at all time points. A lagged autoregressive model was developed to assess the predictive power of symptoms at each time point to the next across the extended postpartum period.ResultsAbout 30% of adolescents displayed early symptoms; 20% showed symptoms at the final time point. Early symptoms did not predict symptoms at 3 months; yet, symptoms at 3 months predicted symptoms at 6–9 months.LimitationsAttrition at final time points necessitated pooled data. Adolescents were primarily older, Hispanics, and recruited from one public hospital decreasing demographic representation. Use of screening tools prevented diagnostic outcomes. Unknown stressors occurring before and after pregnancy or birth may have influenced final outcomes.ConclusionsEarly symptoms were common and 3 month symptoms predicted later symptoms.

At baseline and six-week post-treatment, we applied culturally adapted measures to assess symptoms of Prolonged Complex Bereavement Disorder (PCBD) and adaptive capacity to psychosocial disruptions, based on the Adaptive Stress Index (ASI). The ASI comprises five sub-scales of safety/security (ASI-1); bonds and networks (ASI-2); injustice (ASI-3); roles and identity (ASI-4); and existential meaning (ASI-5).Results: Multilevel linear models indicated that the relationship between baseline and posttreatment PCBD symptoms was mediated by the ASI scale scores. Further, ASI scale scores assessed posttreatment mediated the relationship between baseline and posttreatment PCBD symptoms.

The current study examined longitudinal trajectories of PTSD and MDD symptoms among service members and veterans with comorbid PTSD/MDD. Methods Eligible participants ( n = 1704) for the Millennium Cohort Study included those who screened positive at baseline for both PTSD (PTSD Checklist–Civilian Version) and MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire). Between 2001 and 2016, participants completed a baseline assessment and up to 4 follow-up assessments approximately every 3 years. Mixture modeling simultaneously determined trajectories of comorbid PTSD and MDD symptoms. Multinomial regression determined factors associated with latent class membership. Results Four distinct classes (chronic, relapse, gradual recovery, and rapid recovery) described symptom trajectories of PTSD/MDD. Membership in the chronic class was associated with older age, service branch, deployment with combat, anxiety, physical assault, disabling injury/illness, bodily pain, high levels of somatic symptoms, and less social support. Conclusions Comorbid PTSD/MDD symptoms tend to move in tandem, and, although the largest class remitted symptoms, almost 25% of participants reported chronic comorbid symptoms across all time points. Results highlight the need to assess comorbid conditions in the context of PTSD. Future research should further evaluate the chronicity of comorbid symptoms over time.",597

As borderline personality disorder (BPD) shares similar features to DSO presentations and is commonly associated with PTSD, there is debate as to whether and how CPTSD is distinct from PTSD comorbid with BPD. This article aimed to identify groups with distinct profiles of self-reported CPTSD and BPD symptoms and associated trauma history characteristics. A latent class analysis (LCA) using CPTSD and BPD symptom variables was conducted on a sample of 195 treatment-seeking adults at a specialist trauma service. The classes were then compared on demographic and clinical characteristics using a series of analysis of variance and χ2 tests. The latent class analysis determined three distinct classes: a CPTSD/High BPD class characterized by high symptom endorsement across both conditions, a CPTSD/Moderate BPD class characterized by high PTSD and DSO symptom endorsement and moderate BPD, and a PTSD/Low BPD class characterized by PTSD symptoms and low DSO and BPD symptom endorsement. The two CPTSD classes were associated with greater exposure to multiple, interpersonal traumas earlier in life and exhibited higher functional impairment. Findings support the construct of a CPTSD diagnosis as a separate entity although BPD features seem to overlap greatly with CPTSD symptoms in this highly traumatized clinical sample.

Due to organizational reasons a control group could not be included. Statistical analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA with cPTSD as between-subject factor.The reduction of depressive symptoms at discharge was persistent at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Somatization symptoms were increased at discharge, but were leveled out at 6 months follow-up. The same effect was found for cPTSD symptoms in those patients with non-complex trauma-related disorders: Their increase of cPTSD symptoms was flattened at 6 months follow-up. Patients with a very high risk for cPTSD showed a strong linear reduction of cPTSD symptoms from admission to discharge and 6 months follow-up. cPTSD patients had a higher symptom load compared to patients without cPTSD on all time points and scales.Multimodal, day clinic trauma-focused treatment is associated with positive changes even after 6 and 12 months. Positive therapy outcomes (reduced depression, reduced cPTSD symptoms for patients with a very high risk for cPTSD) could be maintained. However, PTSD symptomatology was not significantly reduced. Increases in somatoform symptoms were leveled out and can therefore be regarded as side effects of treatment, which may be connected with actualization of trauma in the intensive psychotherapeutic treatment. Further analyses should be applied in larger samples and a control group.",599

A limited number of studies examined PTSD factor structure among veterans of recent military conflicts. This study examined the relationship between PTSD factor structure and the hallmark conditions of these conflicts, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and close-range blast exposure (CBE). Method The fit of previously proposed PTSD factor models was compared in a cohort of 387 combat-exposed veterans, with stratified analyses comparing factor structure models between those with a history of military-related mTBI and CBE (n = 106) and those without either of these antecedents (n = 151). CFAs were conducted using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Results The 4-factor emotional numbing (EN) model yielded the best fit when using a clinician-administered assessment of PTSD symptoms regardless of mTBI/CBE exposure status. However, when using a self-report measure of PTSD symptom severity, the EN model yielded best fit for those with mTBI/CBE exposure history while the 5-factor dysphoric arousal (DA) model was preferable among combat-exposed veterans with no history of mTBI/CBE exposure. Conclusions Factors including mTBI and blast exposure and type of assessment tools must be considered when determining preferable PTSD latent factor structure models.

Materials and Methods: This multicenter, prospective, observational study included all patients who were discharged from the ICU. Patients were administered the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level Version (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, the Short-Form Health Survey 36Version 2 (SF-36v2), a socioeconomic question set and the Impact of Event Scale—Revised (IES-R) to assess PTSD. Results: The multivariate logistic regression model found that an International Standard Classification of Education Score (ISCED) higher than 2 (OR 3.42 (95% CI 1.28–9.85)), monthly income less than EUR 1500 (OR 0.36 (95% CI 0.13–0.97)), and more than two comorbidities (OR 4.62 (95% CI 1.33–16.88)) are risk factors for developing PTSD symptoms. Patients with PTSD symptoms are more likely to present a worsening in their quality of life as assessed by EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 scales. Conclusion: The main factors associated with the development of PTSD-related symptoms were a higher education level, a lower monthly income, and more than two comorbidities. Patients who developed symptoms of PTSD reported a significantly lower Health-Related Quality of life as compared to patients without PTSD. Future research areas should be oriented toward recognizing potential psychosocial and psychopathological variables capable of influencing the quality of life of patients discharged from the intensive care unit to better recognize the prognosis and longtime effects of diseases.",601

In military and veteran samples, most available studies have employed self-report measures, assessed PTSD cross-sectionally, used treatment-seeking samples, and assessed symptoms years after deployment. We extend previous studies by comparing the factor structure of clinician-assessed and self-report Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) PTSD in a nontreatment seeking sample at 4 time points spanning the deployment cycle.The data source for this study was the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS), a longitudinal study of 4 battalion cohorts of active-duty male Marines deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan between 2008 and 2012. We examined the fourth cohort (N = 892), which was evaluated 1 month predeployment, and 1, 5, and 8 months postdeployment.Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) revealed that the 5-factor solution best fit the data across all time points, and across both interview and self-report assessments.The temporal consistency and convergence demonstrated by our analyses underscores the validity of the 5-factor model among service members exposed to warzone stressors. In particular, the findings suggest that diagnostic criteria for PTSD may benefit from disaggregating hyperarousal symptoms in military samples.",602

PTG was examined among 4934 participants using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to determine if the original factor structure of the PTGI fits our data and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the appropriate factor structure. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association between PTG and indicators of psychosocial well-being, 9/11-related exposure, and PTSS, controlling for covariates. CFA identified a two-factor structure of the PTGI as a better fit than the original five-factor model. Participants who experienced very high 9/11-related exposure level (ß = 7.72; 95% CI: 5.75–9.70), higher PTSS at waves 1 (ß = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08–0.18) and 2 (ß = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.05–0.14), high social integration (ß = 5.71; 95% CI: 4.47, 6.96), greater social support (ß = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.61), and higher self-efficacy (ß = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.48) had higher PTGI scores.

Our aim was to systematically review (1) the course and predictors of ASD and PTSD after trauma and (2) which and when psychological treatments are effective. METHODS Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Cochrane, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched up to September 14, 2015. Quality was assessed with STROBE and CONSORT checklists. RESULTS Overall, 45 (68%) observational studies and 21 (32%) intervention studies were included. Forty-seven (85%) were of lower (level of evidence (LoE) 3) or poor quality (LoE 4). ASD was found during hospitalization (range 1–37%) and about 30% experienced PTSD 1 month after trauma (LoE 3). The onset of PTSD was within 3 months but also up to 12 months after trauma (LoE 3). Especially in patients with ASD, patients showed PTSD symptoms after 6 years (LoE 3). ASD and PTSD were associated with sociodemographic factors (e.g., being female, younger age, financial problems, and low income), reduced cognitive functioning, and physical (e.g., pain), social (e.g., low social support), and psychological problems (e.g., hyperarousal) or disorders (e.g., ASD). Early treatment in the first weeks after trauma can be preventive for PTSD, but effective treatment for ASD is still unclear. Compared to other psychological treatments, the most effective and examined treatment for PTSD was cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CONCLUSIONS A large number of studies of lower or poor quality present inconsistent findings on the course of ASD and PTSD. Predictors for ASD and PTSD were identified. Early treatment can be preventive for PTSD, as CBT is the most effective treatment. However, good qualitative observational and intervention studies are lacking and needed.

This study investigated the rates of trauma exposure and PTSD, and the role of cumulative trauma exposure and memory as risk factors for PTSD in adults who self-reported having received an ASD diagnosis, compared to a typically developing (TD) comparison group. Questionnaires assessing self-reported frequency of trauma exposure (LEC), PTSD symptomology (PCL-S) and memory (EMQ- R and BRIEF-A) were completed online by 38 ASD adults and 44 TD adults. Rates of trauma exposure and PTSD symptomatology were significantly higher in the ASD group, compared to the TD group, with deficits in working memory and everyday memory mediating this association. Interestingly, a cumulative effect of trauma exposure on PTSD symptom severity was only found in the ASD group. High rates of trauma and probable PTSD in ASD adults highlight the importance of routine screening. Cumulative trauma exposure and memory deficits may act to increase risk of PTSD in ASD; longitudinal research is called for.",606

However, few studies examining PTSD symptom structure have assessed the implications of these proposed models on diagnostic criteria and PTSD prevalence. In the present study, we examined seven alternative DSM-5 PTSD models within a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale-Self-Report for DSM-5 (CPSS-5). Additionally, we generated prevalence rates for each of the seven models by using a symptom-based diagnostic algorithm and assessed whether substance abuse, depression, anxiety symptoms, and daily functioning were differentially associated with PTSD depending on the model used to derive the diagnosis. Participants were 317 adolescents aged 13-17 years (M = 15.93, SD = 1.23) who had experienced a DSM-5 Criterion A trauma and/or childhood adversity. The CFA results showed good fit indices for all models, with the seven-factor hybrid model presenting the best fit. The rates of PTSD diagnosis varied according to each model. The four-factor DSM-5 model presented the highest rate (30.6%), and the seven-factor hybrid model presented the lowest rate (17.4%). Similar to the CFA analysis, the inclusion criteria for the diagnosis based on the hybrid model also presented the strongest associations with daily functional impairment, odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% CI [1.25, 1.75]; and adverse childhood experiences, OR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.16, 1.82].

In order to reliably assess the subtype, we developed the Dissociative Subtype of PTSD Scale (DSPS; Wolf et al., 2017), a 15-item index of dissociative features. Our initial investigation of the dichotomous DSPS lifetime items in a veteran epidemiological sample demonstrated its ability to identify the subtype, supported a three-factor measurement structure, distinguished the three subscales from the normal-range trait of absorption, and demonstrated the greater contribution of derealization and depersonalization symptoms relative to other dissociative symptomatology. In this study, we replicated and extended these findings by administering self-report and interview versions of the DSPS, and assessing personality and PTSD in a sample of 209 trauma-exposed veterans (83.73% male, 57.9% with probable current PTSD). Results replicated the three-factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis of current symptom severity interview items, and the identification of the dissociative subtype (via latent profile analysis). Associations with personality supported the discriminant validity of the DSPS and suggested the subtype was marked by tendencies towards odd and unusual cognitive experiences and low positive affect. Receiver operating characteristic curves identified diagnostic cut-points on the DSPS to inform subtype classification, which differed across the interview and self-report versions. Overall, the DSPS performed well in psychometric analyses, and results support the utility of the measure in identifying this important component of posttraumatic psychopathology.",611

Patients reported both negative and positive psychological sequelae, with prevalence of estimated PTSD ranging from 5% to 16% at each assessment as determined by symptom and cut‐off methods. Posttraumatic stress and growth were positively related, but were differentially associated with outcomes. More posttraumatic stress predicted lower mental health quality of life, whereas more posttraumatic growth predicted better physical health quality of life and longer survival. These relationships persisted after accounting for disease variables and attrition due to death or illness.

Several clinical features indicative of a more severe and complex course have been associated with traumatized ED patients, especially those with PTSD, who may be more likely admitted to residential treatment (RT). Research in this population is sparse but of increasing interest. Method Adult participants (96.7% female) with EDs entering RT ( n = 642) at seven sites in the U.S. completed validated self‐report assessments of ED, PTSD, major depression, state–trait anxiety, and quality of life. Presumptive diagnoses of DSM‐5 PTSD (PTSD+) were made via the Life Events Checklist‐5 and the PTSD Symptom Checklist for DSM‐5. Results PTSD+ occurred in 49.3% of patients. PTSD+ patients had significantly higher scores on all assessment measures ( p ≤ .001), including measures of ED psychopathology, depression, state–trait anxiety, and quality of life. Those with PTSD+ had significantly higher numbers of lifetime traumatic event types, higher rates of almost all lifetime traumatic events, and a greater propensity toward binge‐type EDs. Discussion Results confirm that ED‐PTSD+ patients in RT are more symptomatic and have worse quality of life than ED patients without PTSD+. Integrated treatment approaches that effectively address ED‐PTSD+ are greatly needed.",615

Machine learning models including biomedical data to forecast PTSD outcome after trauma are highly promising for detection of individuals most in need of such interventions. In the current study, machine learning was applied on biomedical data collected within 48 h post-trauma to forecast individual risk for long-term PTSD, using a multinominal approach including the full spectrum of common PTSD symptom courses within one prognostic model for the first time. N = 417 patients (37.2% females; mean age 46.09 ± 15.88) admitted with (suspected) serious injury to two urban Academic Level-1 Trauma Centers were included. Routinely collected biomedical information (endocrine measures, vital signs, pharmacotherapy, demographics, injury and trauma characteristics) upon ED admission and subsequent 48 h was used. Cross-validated multi-nominal classification of longitudinal self-reported symptom severity (IES-R) over 12 months and bimodal classification of clinician-rated PTSD diagnosis (CAPS-IV) at 12 months post-trauma was performed using extreme Gradient Boosting and evaluated on hold-out sets. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to explain the derived models in human-interpretable form. Good prediction of longitudinal PTSD symptom trajectories (multiclass AUC = 0.89) and clinician-rated PTSD at 12 months (AUC = 0.89) was achieved. Most relevant prognostic variables to forecast both multinominal and dichotomous PTSD outcomes included acute endocrine and psychophysiological measures and hospital-prescribed pharmacotherapy. Thus, individual risk for long-term PTSD was accurately forecasted from biomedical information routinely collected within 48 h post-trauma. These results facilitate future targeted preventive interventions by enabling future early risk detection and provide further insights into the complex etiology of PTSD.",616

The Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) is a measure used to assess neurobehavioral symptoms that can occur following a mTBI and has demonstrated a 3- or 4-factor structure in veterans. The present study aimed to investigate the factor structure of veterans with PTSD without a history of mTBI. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on a sample of 221 treatment-seeking veterans and service members with PTSD and without a history of mTBI. Results supported a 4-factor structure comprised of vestibular, somatic, cognitive, and affective domains in veterans with PTSD. Subsequent, correlational analyses between the four NSI factors and the four subscales of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Fifth Edition (PCL-5) revealed high correspondence between the cognitive and affective factors of the NSI and the negative alterations in mood and cognitions and hyperarousal symptom subscales of PTSD. Collectively, findings demonstrated that the NSI functions similarly in veterans with PTSD with or without a history of mTBI. Findings suggest that neurobehavioral symptoms assessed by the NSI appear to be nonspecific and not explicitly associated with mTBI.",617

Relatively few studies, however, have specifically addressed the associated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our clinical practice and therapeutic encounters with adolescents reveal that the majority of bullied adolescents suffer from high levels of PTSD. The objective of this study is to further explore bullied adolescents’ traumatic experiences. In an attempt to analyze these experiences, this article presents a mixed-methods approach. Such an approach will allow to analyze the PTSD that results from bullying as well as subjects’ psychic and family-relevant vulnerabilities. First, bullying will be defined in the context of adolescence. Then the main studies on bullying will be presented. The objectives, tools and methods of analysis will be presented. The interviews will be analyzed according to the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) method. Projective tools, family drawings, Rorschach and Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), will be analyzed using a psychoanalytic interpretation method. Each qualitative tool will be used alongside a validated quantitative tool. The Clinical Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-CA-5 questionnaire) and the interviews conducted will thus allow to analyze PTSD and traumatic experiences. The Family Assessment Device (FAD) and the family drawing test will enable to assess family functioning; lastly, the Symptom Check List (SCL-90) that will be used alongside Rorschach and TAT tests will allow to analyze individual psychological vulnerabilities. This approach will increase data validity. The originality of this research study is based on a mixed-methods approach, our methodology which is based on clinical psychology, and the choice of certain research tools which have received little attention to date. Ultimately, this study may help improve how bullying is identified and could contribute toward the reinforcement or revision of the criteria that characterize bullying. Lastly, it may help us explore various unexamined dimensions of bullying. A possible limitation is the complexity associated with such a protocol.",618

A number of scales measuringPTSD have been developed, including the University of California at Los Angeles Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (UCLA PTSD). The purpose of this study was to establish the psychometric properties of an adapted version of the UCLA PTSD in a sample of conflict-affected adolescents in Kano metropolis, Nigeria. 40 adolescents affected by conflict were selected and completed three self-report instruments, namely, the UCLA PTSD, Posttraumatic stress disorder symptom scale interview (PSSI) and the Experience of students affected by armed conflict (ESAAC), on a single occasion. A convergent validity of the UCLA PTSD was very good at .418 when correlated with the scores of PSSI and a very good divergent validity of -.075 when correlated with the scores of ESAAC. The internal consistency of the UCLA PTSD was also very good at .0886. Findings from the study provide evidence to support the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index as an adequate instrument for assessing PTSD symptoms among conflict-affected adolescents in Nigeria.",619

The symptoms and impact of this disorder can be observed within one month of the event but sometimes can also be observed at a later stage if the person is under events that may trigger the previous accident experience. Predicting the development of PTSD among survivors is a challenge that is addressed through Tr-Estimate, a novel machine learning-based consumer system that has been proposed to indicate the probability of developing PTSD among survivors with various medical histories to improve the health and well-being of the users. The PTSD levels are classified into two levels - PTSD and no PTSD which are again sub-classified into three different categories to accommodate users with medical histories. The prediction of the probability of the development of PTSD is made by continuously monitoring and analyzing the physiological signal parameters of the user.",620

Reliable and valid measures are important for practitioners to screen for PTSD in the Chinese context. This study developed and pilot tested a Chinese version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Methods: The reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the PCL-5 were evaluated in a sample of N = 56 adult psychiatric patients in Taiwan. Online methods were used to facilitate the research process. Results: The Chinese version of the PCL-5 is internally consistent and is associated with trauma exposure and other mental health constructs. Participants with clinically diagnosed DSM-5 PTSD scored significantly higher on the PCL-5 than those without PTSD. The PCL-5 also had an acceptable discrimination performance in this sample. Discussion: Although the initial findings suggest that the PCL-5 is reliable and valid in this pilot study, caution should be taken when interpreting the results. The Chinese version of the PCL-5 may be a promising screening tool, but further psychometric evaluation is necessary.",621

This study explore if perceived social support (PSS) (Social Provisions Scale [SPS]) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Impact of Event Scale [IES-22]) are interrelated among adult victims at four assessment points up until eight years after the exposure to physical assault; soon after the event (T1), three months after T1 (T2), one year after T1 (T3), and eight years after T1 (T4). One hundred and forty-three subjects participated at T1, 94 at T2, 73 at T3, and 47 accepted a follow-up at T4. At T1, 138 of 143 completed the questionnaires within 16 weeks after the incident. PTSD symptoms were highly correlated across time (p < .001); PSS were significantly correlated only between T1 and T2 (p < .001), T1 and T3 (p < .05), and between T2 and T3 (p < .05). Cross-lagged analyses showed an inverse relationship between prior PSS and later PTSD symptoms across all time points (ps < .05); not proved between prior PTSD symptoms and later PSS (ps > .1). PSS at T1 was an independent predictor of PSS one year and eight years after the incident. We conclude that higher perception of social support protects against the development of PTSD symptoms; diminished perception of social support increases the risk of developing PTSD symptoms. These findings suggest that PSS after experiencing a violent assault should be considered as an important factor in natural recovery in the long run, as well as essential alongside psychiatric treatment. Establishing psychosocial interventions for victims of physical violence in the acute phase may prevent prolonged trauma reactions.",622
https://openalex.org/W3008867644,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112871,A longitudinal study of ICD-11 PTSD and complex PTSD in the general population of Israel,"The ICD-11 includes two trauma disorders: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Complex PTSD (CPTSD). CPTSD is a disorder comprised of PTSD and Disturbance in Self-Organization (DSO) symptoms. Evidence supports the construct validity of PTSD and CPTSD, however, the temporal stability of these constructs has rarely been tested. This study examined the diagnostic stability of PTSD and CPTSD, and the temporal associations between PTSD and DSO symptoms over a period of one-year. Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of Israeli adults (n = 1,003) and one year later a random half of this sample were reassessed (n = 543). There were no statistically significant changes in rates of PTSD (6.7%, 5.3%) and CPTSD (4.9%, 3.7%) over time. Latent variable cross-lagged analysis indicated that PTSD and DSO symptoms were stable over time and that DSO symptoms predicted subsequent PTSD symptoms. Results suggest that ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD are stable constructs in the general population over a period of one year. We discuss the possibility that these findings are influenced by the specific cultural context of Israel. Additionally, given the stability and influence of DSO symptoms we discuss the potential value of psychological therapies that directly address these symptoms.",623

Acute traumatic stress symptoms were present in 13% at 1 week and PTSS was prevalent in 10% of the participants at 12 months after injury. Strong prognostic factors for poor psychological outcome in multivariable logistic mixed models were preinjury frailty, psychological complaints and nonworking status preinjury, female sex, low educational level, and accident category (ie, traffic accident, work-related accident, or accidents at home compared to sport injuries).Psychological distress is a common health problem during the first year after injury. Important prognostic factors for psychological distress include psychological complaints before injury and frailty. Early recognition of psychological problems after injury could facilitate discussion between caregivers and patients and improve recovery.",624

We evaluated six competing models of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, including Anhedonia, Externalizing Behaviors, and Hybrid models, using confirmatory factor analyses in a sample of 412 trauma-exposed college students. We then examined whether PTSD symptom clusters were differentially related to measures of anger and impulsivity using Wald chi-square tests. The seven-factor Hybrid model was deemed optimal compared with the alternatives. All symptom clusters were associated with anger; the strongest association was between externalizing behaviors and anger (r = 0.54). All symptom clusters, except reexperiencing and avoidance, were associated with impulsivity, with the strongest association between externalizing behaviors and impulsivity (r = 0.49). A seven-factor Hybrid model provides superior fit to DSM-5 PTSD symptom data, with the externalizing behaviors factor being most strongly related to anger and impulsivity.",625

The aim of this study was to use an experience-sampling procedure to measure the extent to which PTG manifested in individuals’ everyday lives after a recent highly stressful or traumatic adverse event (compared to a control group). In doing so, we developed a state measure of PTG. The factor structure of state PTG was comparable to trait PTG, there was significant variability in individuals’ PTG from moment-to-moment, but individuals’ trait PTG was unrelated to their state PTG. Moreover, individuals who had experienced a recent adversity did not differ from control participants on state PTG.",626

Among health problems in the Veteran population, the most common is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its effect on the quality of life. Prolonged Exposure therapy, based on emotional processing theory, is a first-line treatment for reducing PTSD symptom severity when delivered in an individual format, and its efficacy is well established. The primary objective of this study is to establish the efficacy of prolonged exposure delivered in a small 3-person group modality. Quality of life should improve with decreases in PTSD symptoms such as sleep disturbance, irritability, and hypervigilance. Stigma is associated with hesitation in seeking treatment and treatment dropout. A secondary objective is to measure the effect of group treatment on reducing the stigma surrounding PTSD. Methods/design. This study is a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of Group Prolonged Exposure (PE) for reducing PTSD symptom severity and improving quality of life in male Afghanistan and Iraq Veterans. All participants are randomly assigned to receive Group PE or Group Present-Centered Therapy (PCT) for 10-weekly, 90-min sessions. Group PE focuses on processing trauma memories, while the goal of Group PCT is improved psychosocial functioning through management of current stressors. The primary outcome is improvement in CAPS-5 PTSD symptom severity scores and quality of life measures (WHO-QOL and SF-36) from pre-treatment to post-treatment, 3-months post-treatment, and 6-months post-treatment. A secondary outcome is reductions in perceived self-stigma of mental illness based on the Stigma Scale at baseline and follow-up points. This study is designed to expand access to this first-line treatment for PTSD by delivering PE in a small group modality while conforming to the individual PE protocol, with group treatment reducing perceived stigma of mental illness.",627

We estimated longitudinal trajectories of PTSS from ED to 1 year after evaluation for suspected ACS (N = 1000), and the effect of threat perceptions and discharge diagnosis. Participants reported on threat perceptions in the ED, ongoing cardiac threat at 1 month, and PTSS at 1, 6, and 12 months. Latent growth mixture modeling identified 3 PTSS trajectories over 1 year: Resilient (81.75%), Chronic-Worsening (13.69%), and Acute-Recovering (4.56%). Chronic-Worsening and Acute-Recovering classes reported significantly higher ED and cardiac threat perceptions than Resilient class. Discharge diagnosis did not differ (χ2(2) = 2.93, p = .231). PTSS are common following evaluation for suspected ACS, and trajectories vary, but targeting threat perceptions may reduce PTSS and improve clinical course, whether or not patients are ultimately diagnosed with ACS.",629
https://openalex.org/W2560084149,10.1037/tra0000236,Is posttraumatic growth trauma-specific? Invariance across trauma- and stressor-exposed groups.,"Posttraumatic growth (PTG), or multidimensional positive change following a traumatic event (TE), is conceptualized as qualitatively distinct from growth following a nontraumatic stressful event (NTSE; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004; Zoellner & Maercker, 2006). However, the degree to which PTG is a trauma-specific phenomenon has yet to be established. Although research indicates that individuals who experience TEs endorse greater PTG than those who experience NTSEs (Kastenmüller et al., 2012; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996), factorial invariance and latent mean differences in PTG between these groups have yet to be examined. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to extend previous findings by examining the factorial invariance of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) across groups whose worst stressor was a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. [DSM-5]; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) Criterion A event or a non-Criterion A event.Participants were 644 undergraduates who reported experiencing a stressful event and completed the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) and PTGI.Results indicated that the previously identified 5-factor model of the PTGI provided the best fit, although fit was mediocre. A higher order model significantly worsened model fit and thus was rejected. Unexpectedly, strong factorial invariance and equivalence of latent means were found, indicating that the factor structure and latent means of PTG were identical across groups.Findings indicate that PTG might not be qualitatively or quantitatively distinct from growth due to NTSEs, and TEs and NTSEs elicit similar levels of PTG. Limitations include cross-sectional design. (PsycINFO Database Record",630

Unraveling the complexities of PTSD symptoms over time is crucial for understanding this condition. Going beyond a common pathogenic pathway perspective, we applied the network approach to psychopathology to analyze longitudinal data from war survivors with PTSD in five Balkan countries approximately 8 years after war in the region and a follow‐up assessment 1 year later ( N = 698). PTSD diagnosis was established using the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Impact of Events Scale–Revised. Undirected cross‐sectional networks for baseline and follow‐up revealed no differences in the overall connectivity between these two networks. The intrusion symptom “I had waves of strong feelings about it” had the strongest expected influence centrality. Directed cross‐lagged panel network models indicated that hyperarousal symptoms predicted other PTSD symptoms from baseline to follow‐up, whereas several avoidance symptoms were predicted by other PTSD symptoms. The findings underscore the importance of emotional reactions and further suggest that hyperarousal symptoms may influence other PTSD symptoms. Future research should investigate causality and associations between between‐person and within‐person networks.",631

This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly translated Bangla PCL-5.A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 10,605 individuals (61.0% male; mean age: 23.6 ± 5.5 [13-71 years]) during May and June 2020, several months after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. The survey included the Bangla PCL-5 and the PHQ-9 depression scale. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test the four-factor DSM-5 model, the six-factor Anhedonia model, and the seven-factor hybrid model.The Bangla PCL-5 displayed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90). The Bangla PCL-5 score was significantly correlated with scores of the PHQ-9 depression scale, confirming strong convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated the models had a good fit to the data, including the four-factor DSM-5 model, the six-factor Anhedonia model, and the seven-factor hybrid model. Overall, the seven-factor hybrid model exhibited the best fit to the data.The Bangla PCL-5 appears to be a valid and reliable psychometric screening tool that may be employed in the prospective evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder in Bangladesh.",632

The DSM‐5 conceptualizes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a single, broad diagnosis, whereas the ICD‐11 proposes two “sibling” disorders: PTSD and complex PTSD (CPTSD). The objectives of the current study were to: (a) compare prevalence rates of PTSD/CPTSD based on each diagnostic system; (b) identify clinical and behavioral variables that distinguish ICD‐11 CPTSD and PTSD diagnoses; and (c) examine the diagnostic associations for ICD‐11 CPTSD and DSM‐5 PTSD. Participants in a predominately female clinical sample ( N = 106) completed self‐report scales to measure ICD‐11 PTSD and CPTSD, DSM‐5 PTSD, and depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, dissociation, destructive behaviors, and suicidal ideation and self‐harm. Significantly more people were diagnosed with PTSD according to the DSM‐5 criteria (90.4%) compared to those diagnosed with PTSD and CPTSD according to the ICD‐11 guidelines (79.8%). An ICD‐11 CPTSD diagnosis was distinguished from an ICD‐11 PTSD diagnosis by higher levels of dissociation ( d = 1.01), depression ( d = 0.63), and borderline personality disorder ( d = 0.55). Diagnostic associations with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation and self‐harm were higher for ICD‐11 CPTSD compared to DSM‐5 PTSD (by 10.7%, 4.0%, and 7.0%, respectively). These results have implications for differential diagnosis and for the development of targeted treatments for CPTSD.",633

Past studies have indicated that lower self-reported – but not behaviorally observed – DT is associated with greater PTSD symptoms; however, studies in racially and socioeconomically diverse clinical samples are lacking. The current study evaluated associations between multiple measures of DT (self-report and behavioral) and PTSD symptoms in an urban, racially and socioeconomically diverse, acute-care psychiatric inpatient sample. It was hypothesized that lower self-reported DT (Distress Tolerance Scale [DTS]), but not behavioral DT (breath-holding task [BH]; mirror-tracing persistence task [MT]), would be associated with greater PTSD symptoms, above and beyond the variance contributed by trauma load, substance use, gender, race/ethnicity, and subjective social status. Participants were 103 (41.7% women, Mage = 33.5) acute-care psychiatric inpatients who endorsed exposure to potentially traumatic events consistent with DSM-5 PTSD Criterion A. Results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that DTS was negatively associated with PTSD symptom severity (PCL-5 Total) as well as with each of the four DSM-5 PTSD symptom clusters (p’s < 0.001), contributing between 5.0%–11.1% of unique variance in PTSD symptoms across models. BH duration was positively associated with PTSD arousal symptom severity (p < 0.05). Covariates contributed between 21.3%–40.0% of significant variance to the models. Associations between DT and PTSD in this sample of acute-care psychiatric inpatients are largely consistent with those observed in community samples.",634

Telomere length (TL) and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are biomarkers known to be associated with CA and PTEs, and PTSD, but there is considerable heterogeneity in findings.This study aims to investigate the association of CAs, PTEs, and PTSD with TL and HCC in a high-risk sample of young adults who were previously placed in youth residential care institutions throughout Switzerland.Our sample includes 130 participants (30.8% women, M Age = 26.5 ± 3.7 years) with previous youth residential care placements (MPlacements= 3.9). CAs and PTEs, as well as PTSD, were assessed with self-reported questionnaires and semi-structured clinical interviews. Immune cell TL was measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in whole blood. Hair samples were collected for HCC measurement and assayed with high-sensitivity ELISA. Multivariate regression models were fitted to describe the associations between CAs, PTEs, and PTSD with TL and HCC, adjusting for covariates.In our high-risk sample, a higher burden of CAs, PTEs, Criterion A trauma, and PTSD was associated with longer TL. PTEs, Criterion A trauma, and PTSD were associated with lower HCC, however no significant associations between CAs and HCC were found. The magnitude of these effects varied depending on the dimensional or categorical nature of the stress-phenotype and the specific measure used.Our findings are in contrast with many, but not all, previous studies of associations between adversity and both TL and HCC. For instance, our findings are in line with other studies that find a state of hypocortisolism in PTSD. Better measurement of adversities and trauma, multisystem biomarker approaches, and more research in larger high-risk samples at the upper end of the adversity-continuum is warranted.",635

The 41 Libyan patients who volunteered to take part in the study were first assessed using the PTSD Checklist. They attended workshops on PTSD symptoms, stress management techniques, and communication skills on three successive days after which they were asked to answer the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations two weeks after they completed the workshops. Among the 39% of the participants who were diagnosed with PTSD prior to the intervention, 15% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD after the intervention. The preintervention scores were consistently higher than the postintervention scores, and there were significant differences in the PTSD Checklist total score and the re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptom scores. This study concluded that in mass-trauma events such as war and natural disasters, PTSD education can reduce the PTSD symptoms of those affected. Whether the benefits of psychoeducation on the participants are long term or short term is recommended for further study due to the limitations imposed by the willingness of the participants to participate, the amount of time they are willing to stay with the program, and the duration of the psychoeducation program itself.",636

We hypothesized that patient- and surrogate-specific risk factors for surrogate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms can be identified early in the course of chronic critical illness.Objectives: To identify risk factors for PTSD symptoms in surrogate decision-makers of chronically critically ill patients.Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the database from a multicenter randomized trial of a communication intervention for chronic critical illness patients and surrogates. Variables preselected for plausible mechanism for increasing PTSD symptoms and identifiable by Day 10 of mechanical ventilation were included in the analysis for association with surrogate PTSD symptoms at 90 days, as measured by the Impact of Events Score–Revised (IES-R). Patient factors included demographics, insurance status, baseline functional status, chronic comorbidities, illness severity, and presence of advance directive. Surrogate variables included demographics, education level and employment, religion, relationship to patient, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score measured at enrollment. Multivariable linear regression models were then constructed for 26 potential risk factors, including biologically or mechanistically plausible confounders for each, with IES-R score as the outcome. All models were adjusted for multiple respondents, using a mixed model, considering the patients as a random factor.Results: Our analysis included 306 surrogates for 224 patients. A total of 49% of patients were female, and mean age was 59 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 56.4–60.7). A total of 71% of surrogates were female, and mean age was 51 years (95% CI, 49.3–52.4). After examining each potential risk factor in a separate multivariable model, only Day-10 surrogate Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score (β coefficient = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.73–1.30) and patient unresponsiveness (β coefficient = 8.39; 95% CI, 0.83–15.95) were associated with higher IES-R scores.Conclusions: Among surrogate decision-makers for chronically critically ill patients, high anxiety and depression scores and patient unresponsiveness on or near Day 10 of mechanical ventilation are risk factors for PTSD symptoms at 90 days.",637
https://openalex.org/W2409379956,10.1037/pas0000287,Dimensional latent structure of PTSD-symptoms reporting: Is it adding by subtracting?,"Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is used as a distinct diagnosis in clinical practice, its symptoms were characterized as a dimensional structure in several taxometric analyses. However, a categorical latent structure of PTSD could be superimposed by using indistinct PTSD symptoms that can appear within the framework of other trauma-induced syndromes (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders). For that reason, in revising the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), a core set of cardinal symptoms that determine the presence of PTSD as selectively as possible will be used. To determine whether the latent status of a recommended core set of PTSD symptoms is dimensional, the authors analyzed the latent status of PTSD symptoms reported by participants who had experienced at least 1 traumatic event during their lifetime in 2 nationwide surveys of the German population (N = 1,212). Using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), they applied 3 popular taxometric methods: maximum eigenvalue, mean above minus below a cut, and latent mode factor analysis, using the core set and PTSD symptom clusters of previous taxometric studies. Although the analysis replicated findings of previous taxometric analyses using symptom clusters, the item core-set approach indicated a categorical solution of PTSD cardinal symptoms. These results seem to support the procedure used by the ICD-11 expert group. (PsycINFO Database Record",638

We hypothesized that all 3 clusters of the DSM–IV designation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Criterion B: Intrusive recall, Criterion C: Avoidance, and Criterion D: Hypervigilance) would be experienced by pure victims, pure aggressors, and aggressive victims. We also anticipated that PTSD symptoms would lead to depression, primarily for victims. Questionnaires were given to 1,398 students, yielding 1,116 valid questionnaires (80% response rate). Respondents were enrolled in the general education system, from 9 different schools in Israel. Following calibration of the research instruments using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, a series of structural equation and reflection models were examined. The path through some of the symptoms of PTSD and depression was apparent only for victims. For the victims, the indirect model through avoidance predicted depression only for relational victimization. No clear linkage was found among aggression, PTSD, and depression for aggressors. For aggressors, physical aggression was linked with the 3 clusters of PTSD symptoms, but not with depression.",639

Standard procedures for assessing Criterion A (i.e., the ""worst-event"" method) may result in misidentification of trauma exposure status. The purpose of this Internet-based study was to obtain an estimate of the percent of an adult sample that is misidentified as non-Criterion A through use of this method.Two separate samples completed the extended version of the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5; Weathers, Blake, et al., 2013b). Sample 1 participants (N = 579) completed the LEC-5 via the traditional worst-event method, while Sample 2 participants (N = 569) completed follow-up questions for every event endorsed on the LEC-5, as well as a measure of posttraumatic stress symptoms.The majority of each sample identified a worst event that met Criterion A (Sample 1 = 58.5%; Sample 2 = 54.3%). Of the 202 participants in Sample 2 whose worst event did not meet Criterion A, 69.6% reported at least one other Criterion A event. Additionally, posttraumatic stress symptoms (i.e., severity and factor structure) in Sample 2 did not differ between those with a worst event that met Criterion A and those with a secondary event that met Criterion A, even though the identified worst event did not.When assessing trauma exposure via self-report, a written narrative and follow-up questions should be requested for all events that are endorsed.

It affects a significant population, including COVID-19 patients, frontline health workers, and war veterans. Given biases associated with self-assessment and diagnosis of PTSD, researchers are actively searching for unbiased biological markers (biomarkers) for predicting PTSD status. The Systems Biology of PTSD Consortium has collected candidate biomarkers for PTSD using molecular and clinical measurements of male war veterans between the ages of 20 and 60. PTSD-positive and negative subjects were separated based on the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores, derived from structured interviews to measure an individual’s abundance of symptoms, such as re-experiencing, flashbacks, and hyperarousal. CAPS scores higher than 40 were considered PTSD-positive and below 20 were considered negative. We created artificial neural network models to classify PTSD-positive and negative individuals based on metabolomics, micro-RNA (miRNA), protein expression, endocrine markers, and DNA methylation datasets. Model training involved 64 iterations of a Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization algorithm with 5-fold cross-validation. Each model was calibrated based on cross-validation performance and variance across iterations and then fit to the entire respective dataset (76 PTSD-positive, 76 PTSD-negative). We applied the trained models to an independent validation cohort to assess accuracy on unseen datasets. The top performing datasets from the validation cohort based on classification accuracy were metabolomics (65.2%) and protein expression (61.8%). We anticipate the candidate biomarkers identified in this and future studies will assist with the diagnosis of PTSD.",641

This pilot study aimed to empirically validate the construct of PCTS utilizing the Post-Traumatic Checklist (PCL-5), an existing measure of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Using mixed methods, the survey asked about the traumagenic impact of arrests, court proceedings, incarceration, probation/parole supervision, and sex offender registration requirements in a sample of people required to register as sexual offenders (RSOs; n = 290) and their family members ( n = 126). The PCL-5 was used to estimate the prevalence of PTSD and to explore the unique presentation of symptoms. Findings indicated that 69% of registrants and 62% of family members reported clinically significant indicators of PTSD. Examples of specific symptom presentations are illustrated through qualitative responses. Implications for clinical treatment, policy, and future research related to PCTS are discussed.",642

A longitudinal cohort study was conducted with 105 individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI admitted to a trauma referral center in 2005–2007. Demographics and injury-related factors were extracted from medical records. At the one-, two- and five-year follow-ups, community integration was measured by the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ). A hierarchical linear model (HLM) examined whether longitudinal trajectories of community integration could be predicted by: time, sex, age, relationship status, education, employment status, occupation, acute Glasgow Coma Scale score, cause of injury, days in post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), computed tomography Marshall Score, and Injury Severity Score. CIQ scores improved across the three time-points (p<0.001). Additionally, higher trajectories of community integration were predicted by being single at the time of injury (p<.001), higher level of education (p=0.006), employment (p<0.001), and a shorter length of PTA (p<0.001). In a follow-up HLM with interaction terms, time*PTA was statistically significant (p<0.001), suggesting that participants with longer PTA increased in community integration more rapidly than those with shorter PTA. The longitudinal course of community integration described in this study may help rehabilitation professionals to plan more extensive follow-ups and targeted rehabilitation programs in the early stage of recovery for patients with specific demographic and injury characteristics.",643

This study evaluates the performance of the PC-PTSD-5 to determine whether it can be used as a brief alternative to the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in a large public hospital in the southeastern United States. Participants (N = 422; 92.7% Black; 85.8% female; Mage = 42.0 years, SDage = 13.4 years) completed the PCL-5 and PC-PTSD-5 after recruitment from medical clinic waiting rooms and admission lists. Using chance-corrected test quality indices and item response theory (IRT) analyses, we determined optimal cut-scores for screening and examined item performance. Approximately 45.0% of the sample screened positive for probable DSM-5 PTSD using the PCL-5. The PC-PTSD-5 demonstrated high internal consistency and strong associations with PCL-5 scores (total, r = .79; items, rs = .51-.61). A cut-score of one was optimally sensitive for screening (κ[1] = .96), and a cut-score of four had the highest quality of probable efficiency (κ[.5] = .66) for detecting self-reported DSM-5 PTSD on the PCL-5. IRT analyses indicated Item 1 (nightmares, intrusive memories) provided the most information, and other items may not be incrementally useful for this sample. Findings provide preliminary support for the use of the PC-PTSD-5 as a brief alternative to the PCL-5 among chronically trauma-exposed patients in the public healthcare setting.",644
https://openalex.org/W4295897789,10.1002/jts.22877,Event centrality and posttraumatic stress symptoms after traumatic injury: A longitudinal investigation,"Abstract The development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) can occur following a traumatic injury, which may include an increase in negative cognitions. One cognitive construct shown to be associated with the development of PTSS is event centrality, or the degree to which an individual views a traumatic experience as central to their life story. Although cross‐sectional work has demonstrated a robust connection between event centrality and PTSS, the directionality of this association remains unclear. Most previous work has investigated centrality as a predictor of PTSS, although one recent study suggests that PTSS may, in fact, predict event centrality. The current longitudinal study enrolled adult civilian participants ( N = 191) from a Level 1 trauma center following a traumatic injury and assessed both event centrality and PTSS at three points posttrauma (3, 12, and 18 months). A time‐constrained random intercept cross‐lagged panel analysis showed that PTSS predicted event centrality over the 18‐month follow‐up period, B = 0.16, p = .021, but event centrality did not predict PTSS, B = ‐0.27, p = .340. These findings suggest that the development of PTSS following trauma exposure may lead to the perception of the traumatic event as central to an individual's story over time. Further longitudinal research is necessary to determine what variables may influence the connection between PTSS and event centrality.",645

Anxiety sensitivity (AS)-the fear of anxiety-related sensations-is both a vulnerability factor for and consequence of PTSD symptoms. AS also predicts suicide risk. To our knowledge, no study has examined whether AS concerns account for the association between PTSD symptoms and suicide risk.A total of 254 women firefighters completed a web-based mental health survey. The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5) was administered as a prelude to the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) to assess for exposure to a Criterion A event. The PCL-5, Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), and Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) were utilized to assess PTSD symptoms, AS concerns, and suicide risk, respectively. Bootstrap mediation analyses were conducted, controlling for depression symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R).Global and cognitive AS concerns, but neither physical nor social AS concerns, were statistically significant mediators of the relationship between PTSD symptoms (total score, re-experiencing and numbing clusters) and suicide risk. Alternate mediation models testing PTSD symptoms as a mediator of the relationship between AS concerns and suicide risk were not statistically significant, supporting the specificity of our proposed model.Anxiety sensitivity concerns-specifically, cognitive AS concerns-account for the link between PTSD symptoms and suicide risk among women firefighters. Among firefighters with elevated PTSD symptoms, interventions that address cognitive AS concerns may thwart the trajectory to suicidal thoughts and behaviors.",647

Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in public hospital (Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences) Islamabad, Pakistan, from March 2019 to August 2019. Two scales were used, Schema Mode Inventory (SMI) for assessment of maladaptive and adaptive schema, whereas, for PTSD assessment, Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) was used. Total 281 patients of TBI and orthopedic trauma were studied, of which 137 had been diagnosed with orthopedic trauma, 96 were TBI, and 48 had suffered from multiple injuries that were older than 18 years. Result: Simple linear regression showed that maladaptive schema mode was associated with PTSD. Moreover, the result showed that the prevalence of PTSD severity symptoms were greater in survivors with maladaptive than adaptive schema modes. Further result showed that PTSD Symptoms and dysfunctional schema modes were higher in moderate injured patient’s M (42.14) SD (7.36). In the same way, intentionally injured patient’s M (42.70) SD (6.92) and female trauma survivor’s M (42.05) SD (8.26) had higher PTSD symptoms.

Our aim was to examine the relationship between coping strategies used by family decision-makers (FDMs) of critically ill patients and the severity of PICS-F symptoms and to examine the relationship between FDM PICS-F symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Method A single-center, prospective, longitudinal descriptive study was undertaken of FDMs of intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted to a large tertiary care hospital. PICS-F symptoms and coping strategy use were measured upon ICU admission (T1), 30 days (T2) after ICU admission, and 60 days (T3) after ICU admission. HRQOL was measured by the Short Form-36 version 2 at T1 and T3. Results We found a significant prevalence of anxiety (45.8%), depression (25%), and PTSD (11.1%) symptoms among FDMs over the course of the study. The patient mortality rate in our sample was 50%. The HRQOL mental summary score in FDMs was low at T1 and decreased to M = 41.72 (standard deviation = 12.47) by T3. Avoidant coping demonstrated moderate relationships with PTSD symptoms and anxiety at T3. A previous history of anxiety, depression, or PTSD was a significant predictor of PICS-F symptom severity and prevalence. PICS symptom severity at T3 explained 75% of the variance in HRQOL mental summary score. Significance of results This study describes a significant prevalence of PICS-F symptoms in FDMs with a diminished mental HRQOL.",651

The aim of this study was to characterize individual differences in the course of HrQoL following SAH using latent growth mixture modelling (LGMM).A longitudinal study with 113 incident cases of aneurysmal SAH was performed in order to evaluate clinical outcome (Hunt and Hess scale, Barthel-Index, Beck Depression Inventory) and HrQoL data (EQ-5D) at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The heterogeneity in HrQoL courses after SAH was analysed using LGMM.Four subgroups (classes) of different patterns of HrQoL course after SAH were identified. Two of these classes (1 and 3) comprised patients with considerably reduced initial HrQoL, which was associated with more severe symptoms of SAH. Class 1 showing the worst EQ5D-index values during the entire study period. Class 3 experiencing a considerable improvement in HrQoL values. In comparison to classes 1 and 3, class 2 and 4 were characterized by less severe SAH and better functional outcome. An important difference in the disease course between classes 2 and 4 was a temporary increase in depression scores at the 6-month time point in class 4, which was associated with a considerable reduction in HrQoL.The specific clinical parameters characterizing differences between classes, such as severity of SAH, functional outcome, cognitive impairment and post-stroke depression, were identified and the influence of their potential improvement on HrQoL was estimated.By means of LGMM we could classify the course of HrQoL after SAH in four different patterns, which are relevant for the clinical decisions. Clinical parameters, which can be modified in order to improve the course of HrQoL were identified and could help to develop individual therapeutic strategies for the rehabilitation after SAH.",652

The International Trauma Interview (ITI) has been developed for clinicians to assess these new diagnoses but has not yet been evaluated. Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish translation of the ITI by examining the interrater agreement, latent structure, internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity. Methods: In a prospective study, 186 adults who had experienced a potentially traumatic event were assessed with the ITI and answered questionnaires for symptoms of posttraumatic stress, other psychiatric disorders, functional disability, and quality of life (QoL). Results: The diagnostic rate was 16% for PTSD and 6% for CPTSD. Interrater agreement was satisfactory (α = .76), and confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor second-20 order model consistent with the ICD-11 model of CPTSD provided acceptable fit to the data. Composite reliability analysis demonstrated that the ITI possessed acceptable internal reliability, and associations with measures of other psychiatric disorders, insomnia, functional disability, and QoL supported the concurrent validity of the ITI. Conclusion: Swedish ITI shows promise as a clinician-administered instrument to assess and diagnose ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD.Objetivos: La recientemente publicada CIE-11 incluye cambios sustanciales al diagnóstico de Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático (TEPT) e introduce el diagnóstico de TEPT Complejo (TEPT-C).

https://openalex.org/W2521930503,10.5127/jep.050915,Analogue PTSD Symptoms are Best Predicted by State Rumination,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a severe mental disorder characterized by distressing intrusions. Since not all traumatized individuals develop PTSD, it is important to understand its underlying risk factors. So far, several psychological and physiological risk factors have been identified. However, these factors have rarely been examined together. An excellent tool to assess analogue PTSD in a prospective manner is the trauma film paradigm. This study examined relevant psychological and physiological factors in 60 healthy participants before, during and after the presentation of a “traumatic” film clip, including rumination, dissociation, anxiety, mood, cortisol and psychophysiology measures. Moreover, we assessed intrusions and administered the Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R) for one week following the “trauma”. Surprisingly, the only significant predictor for both intrusion frequency and IES-R was rumination about the film (state rumination). Furthermore, intrusion distress was predicted by both state rumination and an increase in anxiety after the film clip. Our study highlights the relevance of rumination in PTSD. Further well designed clinical studies with PTSD patients should investigate these key variables prospectively to confirm our findings.",655

In between sessions, patients participated in sport activities and psycho-education sessions. No prior stabilization phase was implemented. PTSD symptom scores of clinician-administered and self-administered measures were analysed using the data of 165 consecutive patients. Pre-post differences were compared between four trauma groups; patients with a history of childhood sexual abuse before age 12 (CSA), adolescent sexual abuse (ASA; i.e. sexual abuse between 12 and 18 years of age), sexual abuse (SA) at age 18 and over, or no history of sexual abuse (NSA).Results: Large effect sizes were achieved for PTSD symptom reduction for all trauma groups (Cohen’s d = 1.52–2.09). For the Clinical Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES), no differences in treatment outcome were found between the trauma (age) groups. For the PTSD Symptom Scale Self Report (PSS-SR), there were no differences except for one small effect between CSA and NSA.Conclusions: The results do not support the hypothesis that the presence of a history of childhood sexual abuse has a detrimental impact on the outcome of first-line (intensive) trauma-focused treatments for PTSD.",656

We used latent class growth analysis to identify the longitudinal trajectories of grief assessed using the Inventory for Complicated Grief. To validate the trajectory that corresponded to prolonged grief, we examined the baseline predictors of these trajectories and their relationship with functional impairment.We found three distinct trajectories of grief reactions. One of these trajectories (13.8%) showed high and sustained grief reactions that persisted for almost 7.5 years after the death. Participants with prolonged grief showed greater functional impairment [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70 to -0.97; p = 0.02] and higher self-reported depression (RRR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.96; p = 0.001) than participants whose grief reactions subsided over time. The original PCBD (requiring 6 criterion C symptoms) criteria correctly identified cases (57.9-94.7%) with perfect specificity (100%) but low to high sensitivity (5.6-81.3%); however, its sensitivity increased when revising criterion C to require ⩾3 (45.5-94.1%). The dimensional approach showed high sensitivity (0.50-1) and specificity (0.787-0.97).We recommend revisions to the PCBD criteria, which are overly restrictive and may exclude cases with clinically significant grief-related distress and impairment. In the meantime, clinicians need to monitor grief symptoms over time using available dimensional approaches to reduce the burden of grief.",657

There is limited knowledge about how symptoms of PG and PTS co-occur following such events. The current study aimed to identify patterns of DSM-5-TR defined PG symptomatology and PTS in a sample of 213 youngsters, involved in a school bus accident killing seven peers 2 months earlier. Using latent class analysis, three groups were identified evidencing moderate endorsement of most symptoms (Class 1), high endorsement of almost all but the avoidance symptoms (Class 2), and high endorsement of almost all symptoms (Class 3), respectively. Classes differed in terms of levels of grief, PTS, and depression, assessed concurrently, and-in a subgroup of n=137 participants-assessed at 16 month follow-up. E.g., Class 3 membership was associated with a greater likelihood of meeting criteria for DSM-5-TR defined prolonged grief disorder at follow-up. Gender (fewer females in Class 1) but not age and proximity to the accident were associated with class membership. Findings indicate that it is important to identify groups with elevated PG and PTS early after traumatic bereavement who may be en route to persistent mental health problems.",658

However, little is known about the neural correlates of the recovery process from PTSD. A 5-year longitudinal study was conducted to investigate the trajectory of structural connectivities of the amygdala in disaster survivors with PTSD. Thirty disaster survivors, who were diagnosed with PTSD, and 29 healthy individuals, who were not exposed to trauma, underwent three waves of assessments including neuroimaging scanning over a 5-year period from the time of the disaster at approximately 1.3-year intervals. All disaster survivors showed significant improvements in PTSD symptoms over time. Using diffusion tensor imaging analysis, a 5-year trajectory of amygdalar structural connectivities with key brain regions was assessed. The amygdala–insula connection was initially strengthened and then normalized during recovery, while the amygdala–prefrontal cortex (PFC) connection was at first unaffected, then strengthened, and eventually normalized. The lower tract strength of the amygdala–thalamus connection normalized during recovery, while that of amygdala–hippocampus connection remained low. The greater amygdala–PFC connectivity was associated with less PTSD symptom severity. The present longitudinal study revealed that recovery from PTSD parallels dynamic and sequential shifts in amygdalar connectivities with multiple brain regions, suggesting the expanded view of fear circuitry including the insula and thalamus, beyond the traditional model which primarily involves the amygdala, PFC, and hippocampus.",659

However, few studies examine the longitudinal progression of PTSD symptoms concurrent with related symptom domains and functional outcomes, such that may neglect important longitudinal patterns of symptom progression beyond PTSD specifically.Therefore, we used longitudinal causal discovery analysis to examine the longitudinal interrelations among PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, substance abuse, and various other domains of functioning in five longitudinal cohorts representing veterans (n = 241), civilians seeking treatment for anxiety disorders (n = 79), civilian women seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress and substance abuse (n = 116), active duty military members assessed 0-90 days following TBI (n = 243), and civilians with a history of TBI (n = 43).The analyses revealed consistent, directed associations from PTSD symptoms to depressive symptoms, independent longitudinal trajectories of substance use problems, and cascading indirect relations from PTSD symptoms to social functioning through depression as well as direct relations from PTSD symptoms to TBI outcomes.Our findings suggest PTSD symptoms primarily drive depressive symptoms over time, tend to show independence from substance use symptoms, and may cascade into impairment in other domains. The results have implications for refining conceptualization of PTSD co-morbidity and can inform prognostic and treatment hypotheses about individuals experiencing PTSD symptoms along with co-occurring distress or impairment.",660

This study aimed to (a) determine the probable recovery trajectories in physical and mental HRQoL; (b) examine the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on HRQoL scores within these trajectory groups; and (c) examine the influence of predictor covariates on trajectory group membership. 336 (63% female, Mage =44.72; SD =14.77) injured RTC survivors completed the SF-36v2 at approximately 6, 12, and 24 months after sustaining a RTC injury. Participants also completed telephone interviews to assess prior history of psychological disorder and current PTSD at each wave. Three trajectories were identified for SF-36v2 Physical Component Score (PCS): ”gradual recovery” (27.3%);”low but improving” (54.7%); and”severe and chronic” (17.9%). Four trajectories were defined for SF36v2 Mental Component Score (MCS): “unaffected” (19.1%);”severe but improving” (24.1%);”severe and declining” (17.3%); and”low but improving” (39.5%). A PTSD diagnosis significantly reduced SF36v2 component scores only in trajectories associated with poorer outcome. Age was predictive of trajectory group membership for PCS, whereas injury severity was predictive of trajectory group membership for MCS. Use of a compensation seeking sample affects generalizability to the general RTC population. This study identified a concerning subgroup of individuals who have chronic and/or declining physical and mental HRQoL that can be impacted by a diagnosis of PTSD. The development of interventions with a special focus on associated psychological injury is needed to improve the HRQoL of at-risk individuals following RTC injury.",661
https://openalex.org/W2981114452,10.1097/ta.0000000000002505,Development and validation of a revised trauma-specific quality of life instrument,"BACKGROUND The National Academies of Science has called for routine collection of long-term outcomes after injury. One of the main barriers for this is the lack of practical trauma-specific tools to collect such outcomes. The only trauma-specific long-term outcomes measure that applies a biopsychosocial view of patient care, the Trauma Quality-of-Life (T-QoL), has not been adopted because of its length, lack of composite scores, and unknown validity. Our objective was to develop a shorter version of the T-QoL measure that is reliable, valid, specific, and generalizable to all trauma populations. METHODS We used two random samples selected from a prospective registry developed to follow long-term outcomes of adult trauma survivors (Injury Severity Score ≥9) admitted to three level I trauma centers. First, we validated the original T-QoL instrument using the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) version 2.0 and Breslau post-traumatic stress disorder screening (B-PTSD) tools. Second, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to reduce the length of the original T-QoL instrument, and using a different sample, we scored and performed internal consistency and validity assessments of the revised T-QoL (RT-QoL) components. RESULTS All components of the original T-QoL were significantly correlated negatively with the B-PTSD and positively with the SF-12 mental and physical composite scores. After confirmatory factor analysis, a three-component structure using 18 items (six items/component) most appropriately represented the data. Each component in the revised instrument demonstrated a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's α ≥0.8) and correlated negatively with the B-PTSD and positively with the SF-12, demonstrating concurrent validity. In addition, each of the RT-QoL components was able to distinguish between individuals based on their work status, with those who have returned to work reporting better health. CONCLUSION This more practical RT-QoL measure greatly increases the ability to evaluate long-term outcomes in trauma more efficiently and meaningfully, without sacrificing the validity and psychometric properties of the original instrument.

https://openalex.org/W3208467590,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.09.218,206 Development and Validation of a Simple Clinical Prediction Tool to Identify Individuals in the Emergency Department at High Risk of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder After Motor Vehicle Collision,"Approximately 4 million individuals are seen in US EDs after motor vehicle collision (MVC) each year. The overwhelming majority (>90%) are discharged to home after evaluation. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a relatively common sequelae in this population, occurring in ∼15-30% of individuals discharged to home from the ED. No ED-based or ED-initiated secondary preventive interventions are routinely available to prevent PTSD among those at high risk. The development of such interventions has been hampered by the lack of a simple clinical prediction tool that can be used in the ED to risk stratify individuals for PTSD risk. We sought to develop and validate such a tool. ED patients 18-75 years old were recruited at 28 ED sites. Candidate predictive baseline characteristics assessed (n=265) spanned 11 risk factor domains, including sociodemographic characteristics, lifetime trauma, pre-trauma stressors and psychological distress, pre-trauma mental and physical health, MVC characteristics, peritraumatic symptoms, personality, and social support. PTSD was defined by a PCL-5 score ≥ 38 at 3-month follow-up. Inverse missing probability weighting was used to balance baseline characteristics with full cohort (eg, 20% without 3-month follow-up). Lasso logistic regression with nested binary variables for identified influential factors was used to develop the predictive tool in the derivation sample (19 ED sites in 13 states, n=1282). Application of tool in the validation sample (11 different ED sites in 6 states, n=286) was used to assess generalizability. In derivation and validation samples (n=1570, 68% female, 33% non-Hispanic White, mean age 36), 26% met criteria for 3-month PTSD. A simple 8-item tool had AUC=0.83 with excellent calibration in the derivation cohort, and AUC=0.76 with continued excellent calibration in the validation cohort. (The tool also had AUC=0.78 and excellent calibration in a separate non-MVC sample.) At thresholds of .3 and .4, the tool had sensitivity/specificity of 69%/80% and 58%/85%, respectively. The most important predictors were anxiety sensitivity, pre-MVC depressive and distress symptoms, and peritraumatic psychophysiological symptoms. A simple 8 question tool can be used in the ED to help identify those at high risk of PTSD. This tool may be useful in clinical trials testing secondary preventive interventions for PTSD.",663

QoL was assessed using the Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) of Short-Form Health Survey upon diagnosis and two years later. Growth mixture models were applied on 1158 patients and 3 trajectories over time were identified for MCS: 75% of patients had constantly high scores, 13% had permanently low scores and 12% starting with low scores had a recovery; the predictors that differentiated the trajectories were age, comorbidities, a family history of PCa, and the bowel, urinary and sexual functional scores at diagnosis. In the physical domain, 2 trajectories were defined: 85% of patients had constantly high scores, while 15% started with low scores and had a further slight decrease. Two years after diagnosis, the psychological and physical status was moderately compromised in more than 10% of PCa patients. For mental health, the trajectory analysis suggested that following the compromised patients at diagnosis until treatment could allow identification of those more vulnerable, for which a level 2 intervention with support from a non-oncology team supervised by a clinical psychologist could be of help.",664

The mediational role of depressive symptoms in the relationship between each PTSS cluster and physical health symptoms, pain symptoms, or presence of chronic pain was also tested. Method: Individuals who reported to have suffered a traumatic experience (N = 100) participated in the study. They were recruited through organizations offering services for victims of violence, self- help groups, newspaper announcements, and the outpatient clinic. Participants were interviewed with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for DSM-IV and the German versions of the Clinician- Administered PTSD Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Freiburg Complaints Scale. Results: Regression analysis showed that both hyperarousal and depressive symptoms accounted for unique variances of physical health symptoms (partial r2 were .03 and .11, respectively). Bootstrap analysis indicated that whereas hyperarousal was both directly and indirectly (through depressive symptoms) related to physical health symptoms, avoidance/numbing and re-experience were only indirectly related with physical health symptoms via depressive symptoms. For pain symptoms, only depressive symptoms were uniquely related with this variable (partial r2 was .05). Depressive symptoms mediated the relationship between the three PTSS clusters and pain symptoms, but not the relationship between the clusters and the presence of chronic pain. Hyperarousal was the only variable uniquely and directly related with the presence of chronic pain (OR = 3.01; p <.05). Conclusions: These data highlight the importance of treating depressive and hyperarousal symptoms in order to improve physical health and pain in trauma-exposed individuals.",665

Design: Participants were 258 trauma-exposed Iraq/Afghanistan war veterans. Methods: A self-report measure of PTSD symptoms was administered to all participants and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to compare several different models of PTSD. Results: CFA revealed that the best-fitting model was a six-factor model in which symptoms loaded onto the factors of intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal. Conclusions: These findings have important implications for ongoing conceptualization of PTSD and suggest that additional modifications to the diagnostic criteria for PTSD may still be warranted to more accurately reflect the underlying structure of PTSD symptoms.",666
https://openalex.org/W4212774825,10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.390,Suicidality in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD),"Introduction International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) has inserted complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) as a clinically distinct disorder, different from PTSD. The diagnosis of cPTSD has the same requirements for the one of PTSD, in addition to disturbances of self-organization (DSO – e.g., disturbances in relationships, affect dysregulation, and negative self-concept). Objectives This study aimed to explore suicidality in PTSD and cPTSD. We examined also the association between clinical dimensions of hopelessness (feelings, loss of motivation, future expectations) and other symptomatologic variables. Methods The sample, recruited at the Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy, consisted of 189 subjects, 132 diagnosed with PTSD, and 57 with cPTSD, according to the ICD-11 criteria. Participants underwent the following clinical assessments: Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90), Dissociative Experience Scale (DES), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Results cPTSD showed significantly higher BHS-total (p = 0.01) and BHS-loss of motivation subscale (p &lt;0.001) scores than PTSD. Besides, cPTSD showed significantly higher scores in all clinical variables except for the IES-intrusive subscale. By controlling for the confounding factor “depression”, suicidality in cPTSD (and in particular the BHS-total) appears to be correlated with IES-total score (p = 0.042) and with DES-Absorption (p = 0.02). Differently, no such correlations are found in PTSD. Conclusions Our study shows significant symptomatologic differences between PTSD and cPTSD, including suicidality. Indeed, suicidality in cPTSD appears to be correlated with the “loss of motivation” dimension, which fits well within the ICD-11 criteria of DSO. Disclosure No significant relationships.",667

Catastrophizing has been linked to both phenomena. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying role of catastrophizing in PTSD symptoms and pain following burns.This prospective study included 216 patients with burns. PTSD symptoms and pain were measured during hospitalization (T1) and 6 (T2) and 12 months (T3) postburn. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) indexed PTSD symptoms. Acute pain (T1) was the mean pain during the first two weeks of hospitalization measured using an 11-point graphic numeric rating scale. Chronic pain was indexed using the single item 'average' pain from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Catastrophizing was measured at T1 and T2 using the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM).The results showed that T2 catastrophizing mediated between acute and chronic PTSD symptoms, and T3 pain. Furthermore, the study revealed significant associations between catastrophizing, PTSD symptoms and pain at the respective measurements, and significant longitudinal associations between the constructs.A negative cognitive-affective response to a burn event, such as catastrophizing, mediated the relationship between acute and chronic PTSD symptoms and later chronic pain. Screening for catastrophizing and acute PTSD symptoms is recommended to identify persons at risk for chronic PTSD symptoms and pain.The identification of individuals who have the tendency to catastrophize may assist in finding those at risk for development of both chronic PTSD symptoms and chronic pain. Individuals may benefit from early psychological therapy focussing on catastrophizing and acute PTSD symptoms that may ameliorate both chronic PTSD symptoms and pain.",668

The purpose of this study was to describe common trajectories of physical health over time and to examine predictors of these trajectories.Adults with burn injuries completed self-reported assessments of their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by the SF-12® Physical Component Summary (PCS) score at distinct time points (preinjury via recall, index hospital discharge, and at 6-, 12-, and 24 months after injury). Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to model PCS scores over time. Covariables included burn size, participant characteristics, and scores from the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ)/Social Integration portion, Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and Satisfaction With Appearance Scale (SWAP).Data from 939 participants were used for complete-case analysis. Participants were 72% male, 64% non-Hispanic White, with an average age of 44 years and an average burn size of 20% of total body surface area (TBSA). The best fitting model suggested three distinct trajectories (Class 1 through 3) for HRQOL. We titled each Class according to the characteristics of their trajectory. Class 1 (recovering; n = 632), Class 2 (static; n = 77), and Class 3 (weakened; n = 205) reported near average HRQOL preinjury, then reported lower scores at discharge, with Class 1 subsequently improving to preinjury levels and Class 3 improving but not reaching their preinjury quality of life. Class 3 experienced the largest decrease in HRQOL. Class 2 reported the lowest preinjury HRQOL and remained low for the next 2 years, showing minimal change in their HRQOL.These findings emphasize the importance of early universal screening and sustained intervention for those most at risk for low HRQOL following injury. For Class 2 (static), lower than average HRQOL before their injury is a warning. For Class 3 (weakened), if the scores at 6 months show a large decline, then the person is at risk for not regaining their HRQOL by 24 months and thus needs all available interventions to optimize their outcomes. Results of this study provide guidance for how to identify people with burn injury who would benefit from more intensive rehabilitation to help them achieve or regain better HRQOL.

Trained research staff administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (scores ≥ 8 on anxiety and depression subscales indicating substantial symptoms) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R, scores ≥ 1.6 indicating substantial PTSD symptoms) at each follow-up visit.Of 196 consenting survivors, 186 (95%) completed HADS and IES-R assessments; 96 (52%) had any continuous or recurring (prolonged) symptoms, and 71 (38%), 59 (32%), and 43 (23%) had prolonged anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms, respectively (median total durations 33-39 months, 71-100% of observed follow-up time). Prolonged psychiatric symptoms tended to co-occur across domains; the most common morbidity pattern involved substantial symptoms in all three domains. Worse pre-ARDS mental health, including prior depression and psychological distress in the period immediately preceding ARDS, was strongly associated with prolonged post-ARDS psychiatric morbidity across symptom domains.Clinically significant and long-lasting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD are common in the first 5 years after ARDS. In-hospital screening of psychiatric history, including recent anxiety and depression symptoms, may be useful for long-term mental health treatment planning after ARDS.",671

Using pooled efficacy data from six phase 2 trials, therapy using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) appeared cost-saving from a payer's perspective. This study updates the cost-effectiveness analysis of this novel therapy using data from a new phase 3 trial, including the incremental cost-effectiveness of the more intensive phase 3 regimen compared with the shorter phase 2 regimen.We adapted a previously-published Markov model to portray the costs and health benefits of providing MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) to patients with chronic, severe, or extreme PTSD in a recent phase 3 trial, compared with standard care. Inputs were based on trial results and published literature. The trial treated 90 patients with a clinician administered PTSD scale (CAPS-5) total severity score of 35 or greater at baseline, and duration of PTSD symptoms of 6 months or longer. The primary outcome was assessed 8 weeks after the final experimental session. Patients received three 90-minute preparatory psychotherapy sessions, three 8-hour active MDMA or placebo sessions, and nine 90-minute integrative psychotherapy sessions. Our model calculates the per-patient cost of MDMA-AT, net all-cause medical costs, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We reported results from the U.S. health care payer's perspective for multiple analytic time horizons, (base-case is 30 years), and conducted extensive sensitivity analyses. Costs and QALYs were discounted by 3% annually. Costs were adjusted to 2020 U.S. dollars according to the medical component of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI).MDMA-AT as conducted in the phase 3 trial costs $11,537 per patient. Compared to standard of care for 1,000 patients, MDMA-AT generates discounted net health care savings of $132.9 million over 30 years, accruing 4,856 QALYs, and averting 61.4 premature deaths. MDMA-AT breaks even on cost at 3.8 years while delivering 887 QALYs. A third MDMA session generates additional medical savings and health benefits compared with a two-session regimen. Hypothetically assuming no savings in health care costs, MDMA-AT has an ICER of $2,384 per QALY gained.MDMA-AT provided to patients with severe or extreme chronic PTSD is cost-saving from a payer's perspective, while delivering substantial clinical benefit.",672

Trauma exposure is exceedingly common as up to 80% of adults will experience at least one traumatic event at some point in their lifetime. Although only a fraction of these adults will go on to develop and receive a formal diagnosis of PTSD (lifetime prevalence rates of 6.2% to 12% among civilian populations), the societal implications are staggering, as there are approximately 13 million US adults in need of treatment.

Patients were randomly assigned to 12 sessions of Tf-CBT (n = 76) or a WL (n = 83). The primary outcome was the CAPS-CA symptom score assessed at 4 months by blinded evaluators. The secondary measures were diagnostic status, the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), self-reported and caregiver-reported PTSS (UCLA-PTSD Reaction Index), the Child Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), the Screen for Child Anxiety- Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4-18), and the Quality of Life Inventory for Children. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Intention-to-treat analyses showed that Tf-CBT was significantly superior to WL on the CAPS-CA (Tf-CBT: baseline = 58.51 ± 17.41; 4 months = 32.16 ± 26.02; WL: baseline = 57.39 ± 16.05; 4 months = 43.29 ± 25.2; F&lt;sub&gt;1, 157&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.3; p = 0.001; d = 0.50), in terms of secondary measures of the CGAS, UCLA-PTSD-RI, CPTCI, CDI, SCARED, and CBCL/4-18, but not in terms of quality of life.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a pathology that finds its roots in exposure to a life-threatening event or an event related to death. Exposure to fetal death during a late-term fetal demise is, therefore, a situation at risk of trauma. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in the short term among patients faced with late fetal demise, and to identify potential risk factors. All women were assessed at 15 days, one month, and three months after late fetal demise using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ). At 15 days, 44.2% of patients presented a pathological score on the IES-R (≥ 33). At one month and three months, this figure was 34.1% and 9.1% respectively. Factor associated with PTSD symptoms were: peritraumatic dissociation (p = 0.014), seeing the fetus during hospitalization (p = 0.035), holding the fetus in one's arms (p = 0.046), and the organization of a funeral service (p = 0.025). Patients experiencing late fetal demise are at significant risk of trauma. Care providers should remain vigilant to identify high-risk situations to offer appropriate care.Clinical trials registration number: NCT03433989.",675

The aim of the present study was to examine the course of PTS up to three years after losing relatives in the MS Estonia ferry disaster, one of the worst maritime disasters in modern times.Seven postal surveys were sent out over three years post-disaster. The respondents were invited and added consecutively during the three years and 938 relatives participated in one or more of the surveys, representing 89% of the MS Estonia's Swedish victims. The survey included the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to measure PTS. Latent growth curve modeling was used to analyze PTS over time.The majority of bereaved individuals had high levels of PTS. At three years post-loss, 62% of the respondents scored above the recommended cut-off value on the IES. Over time, PTS symptoms declined, but initially high symptoms of PTS were associated with a slower recovery rate.The present finding suggests that being an indirectly-exposed disaster-bereaved close-relative can lead to very high levels of PTS which are sustained for several years.",676

This calls for a brief, multiple dimensional mental health risk screening tool in primary care settings. We aimed to develop such a screening tool named the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Life Adversities Screener (LADS). Using pooled data across 4 studies from the UCLA Center for Culture, Trauma, and Mental Health Disparities, 5 domains of mental health risk including perceived discrimination, sexual abuse histories, family adversity, intimate partner violence, and trauma histories, were identified. Regression models for depression (Centers for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale) and posttraumatic stress disorder (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale), controlling for demographic factors, were fitted to develop a weighted continuous scale score for the UCLA LADS. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the 5-domain structure, while item response theory endorsed the inclusion of each item. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that the score was predictive for classifying subjects as reaching clinical threshold criteria for either depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II ≥ 14 or Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ≥ 10) or anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-13 ≥10). An optimal cut of 0.33 is suggested based on maximizing sensitivity and specificity of the LADS score, identifying patients at high risk for mental health problems. Given its predictive utility and ease of administration, the UCLA LADS could be useful as a screener to identify racial minority individuals in primary care settings who have a high trauma burden, needing more extensive evaluation.",677

Attitudes towards help-seeking are associated with intentions to and actual treatment use, but were neglected in research on trauma survivors so far. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the reliability, construct validity, and predictive power of the Inventory of Attitudes towards Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMHS) and to investigate attitudes of adult institutional abuse survivors. Method: A total of 220 adult survivors of institutional abuse were interviewed using IASMHS, the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short-Form (CTQ-SF), the Life Events Checklist (LEC-5), and the depression-subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). They were further asked about their current mental health service use. We assessed the fit of different models of IASMHS with confirmatory factor analyses and predicted current mental health service use with a binominal logistic regression model. Results: The three-factor structure of IASMHS provided the best fit. One of the three scales (help-seeking propensity), the PTSD-intrusion scale, and the depression scale significantly contributed to the prediction of current mental health service use. Single items of the psychological openness scale loaded weakly on the according factor. Our sample showed a similar IASMHS profile compared to other samples with mental health problems. Conclusion: Overall, IASMHS appears to be a useful instrument to assess attitudes towards seeking mental health services in trauma survivors. It can be used to investigate help-seeking attitudes and its correlates to better understand and facilitate survivors' treatment use.Planteamiento: Aunque existen tratamientos eficaces, muchos sobrevivientes de trauma retrasan o evitan ayuda profesional. Las actitudes respecto a buscar ayuda están asociadas con las intenciones y el uso real del tratamiento, pero, hasta el momento, se han descuidado en la investigación con muestras de trauma. Objetivo: El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo investigar la fiabilidad, la validez de constructo y el poder predictivo del Inventario de actitudes respecto a búsqueda de servicios de salud mental (IASMHS, siglas de Inventory of Attitudes towards Seeking Mental Health Services) e investigar las actitudes de los adultos que han sobrevivido al abuso institucional. Método: Un total de 220 adultos sobrevivientes de abuso institucional fueron entrevistados usando el IASMHS, la Lista de Verificación del TEPT para el DSM-5 (PCL-5, siglas de PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), la versión corta del Cuestionario sobre trauma infantil (CTQ-SF, siglas de Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short-Form), la Lista de verificación de acontecimientos vitales (LEC-5; siglas de Life Events Checklist) y la sub-escala de depresión del Inventario breve de síntomas (BSI-18, siglas de Brief Symptom Inventory). También se les preguntó por su uso actual de servicios de salud mental. Se evaluó cómo encajaban los diferentes modelos del IASMHS con análisis de factores de confirmación y se predijo el uso actual de servicios de salud mental con un modelo de regresión logística binominal. Resultados: La estructura de tres factores del IASMHS fue la que mejor encajó. Una de las tres escalas (propensión a la búsqueda de ayuda), la escala de intrusión del TEPT y la escala de depresión contribuyeron significativamente a la predicción del uso actual de servicios de salud mental. Los elementos individuales de la escala de apertura psicológica se cargaron débilmente en el factor correspondiente. Nuestra muestra mostró un perfil similar del IASMHS en comparación con otras muestras con problemas de salud mental. Conclusión: En general, el IASMHS parece ser un instrumento útil para evaluar las actitudes respecto a la búsqueda de servicios de salud mental en los sobrevivientes de trauma. Puede utilizarse para investigar las actitudes de búsqueda de ayuda y sus correlatos para comprender mejor y facilitar el uso del tratamiento a los supervivientes.背景：尽管有效的治疗存在，许多创伤幸存者延迟或者回避专业帮助。求助态度和对治疗的使用意图以及实际使用有关，但在创伤样本的研究中至今被忽视。 目标：本研究旨在考察使用精神健康服务的求助态度清单（IASMHS）的信效度和预测能力，以及机构内虐待的成年幸存者的求助态度。 方法：使用IASMHS、DSM-5 PTSD检查表（PCL-5）、短版童年创伤问卷（CTQ-SF）、生活事件检查表（LEC-5）和简明症状清单（BSI-18）的抑郁分量表对总共220名机构内虐待的成年幸存者进行访谈。更一步询问了他们目前的精神健康服务的使用。我们使用验证性因素分析评估了IASMHS的不同模型，并使用二项式Logistic回归分析考察其对目前精神健康服务使用的预测能力。 结果：IASMHS的三因子结构拟合最佳。其中的求助倾向量表（help-seeking propensity）、PTSD的闯入量表和抑郁量表对预测目前精神健康服务使用情况有显著贡献。心理开放（psychological openness）题目在相应的因子上载荷较低。我们的样本和其它具有精神健康问题的样本一样，显示相似的IASMHS剖面结构。 结论：总体上，IASMHS是评估创伤幸存者使用精神健康服务求助态度的有用工具。它可以用来考察求助态度，有助于更好理解和促进幸存者的治疗使用行为。.",678

We examined trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) across a 5-year period in children with a history of cancer and their parents/caregivers. Medical, demographic, and dispositional variables were examined as predictors of PTSS trajectories.Using a longitudinal design, children with cancer history (n = 254, age 8-17 years at baseline) and one parent or caregiver (n = 255) completed measures of PTSS at baseline, and 1-, 3-, and 5-years poststudy entry. Children and caregivers completed dispositional measures including optimism, positive or negative affect, and Five-Factor Inventories. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify latent trajectories of PTSS, and univariate logistic regression models were conducted to predict LCGA class membership from medical, demographic, and disposition factors Results: Very similar trajectories were observed in children and caregivers, with two-class solutions providing the best fit: a ""resilient"" class, with low PTSS at baseline, which declined significantly over time (83.5% in children; 71.5% in parents), and an ""elevated PTSS"" class, which was moderately high at baseline and increased significantly over time. There was a small, but significant relationship between child and caregiver trajectories. Latent trajectories observed in children and parents were more strongly associated with dispositional variables than medical factors.Resilience, depicted by low PTSS, is by far the most common outcome observed in both children and caregivers. However, the smaller subset with elevated PTSS do not show recovery over time, and are identified as a group in need of targeted interventions.

We aimed to determine the type, severity, and frequency of symptoms that remain after trauma-focused psychotherapy. We conducted a systematic review of 51 randomized controlled trials of empirically supported psychosocial interventions for PTSD (68 total treatment arms). Outcomes included: 1) PTSD symptoms and 2) conditions commonly comorbid with PTSD: depression, anxiety, and quality of life impairment. In general, the results revealed that participants who completed PTSD treatment continued to report residual PTSD symptoms: 31% reported clinical symptom levels, and 59% reported subthreshold levels at posttreatment, particularly within the hyperarousal cluster. Residual symptoms also emerged for depression (19% clinical), anxiety (55% clinical), and quality of life (36% clinical). Few differences emerged across treatment types, but differential patterns were revealed for sample/trauma types. Results suggest a need for focused research attention to and clinical assessment of individual residual symptoms following empirically supported treatment for PTSD to determine whether further treatment sessions are warranted.",680

Accordingly, acute traumatic stress screening is recommended, but its association with later PTSD symptoms has never been addressed in postresuscitation settings. Objective The aim of this study was to examine whether acute traumatic stress is associated with PTSD symptoms in patients who have had a cardiac arrest and their partners. Methods This multicenter longitudinal study of 141 patients and 97 partners measures acute traumatic stress at 3 weeks and PTSD symptoms at 3 months and 1 year after resuscitation, using the Impact of Event Scale. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between severity of acute traumatic stress and PTSD symptoms and post hoc to explore effects of group (patients/partners), age, and sex on acute traumatic stress severity. We categorized Impact of Event Scale scores higher than 26 at 3 months and 1 year as clinical severe PTSD symptoms . Results Higher acute traumatic stress severity is significantly positively associated with higher PTSD symptom severity at 3 months (patients and partners: P &lt; .001) and 1 year (patients and partners: P &lt; .001) postresuscitation, with the strongest association for women compared with men ( P = .03). Acute traumatic stress was higher in women compared with men across groups ( P = .02). Clinical severe PTSD symptoms were present in 26% to 28% of patients and 45% to 48% of partners. Conclusion Experiencing a cardiac arrest may elicit clinical severe PTSD symptoms in patients, but particularly in their partners. Screening patients and partners for acute traumatic stress postresuscitation is warranted to identify those at increased risk of long-term PTSD symptoms.",681

Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of PTSD, diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria, and of Post-Traumatic Stress Spectrum symptoms in a sample of patients with FM. Methods Sixty-one patients, 7 males and 54 females, with FM, diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) at the Unit of Rheumatology of A.O.U.P clinics, were assessed by: SCID-5; Trauma and Loss Spectrum Self-Report (TALS-SR); Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum). Results Patients with FM with full and partial PTSD reported a significantly higher number of losses and potentially traumatic events in the TALS-SR than patients without PTSD. Significantly, higher AdAS Spectrum scores in almost all domains were reported in patients with PTSD with respect to those with partial or without PTSD. Moderate to good correlations were highlighted amongst most of the TALS-SR and ADAS-Spectrum domains. Conclusions Significant DSM-5 PTSD rates emerged in our sample of patients with FM. Significant correlations were found between Adult Subthreshold Autism Spectrum and Post-Traumatic Stress Spectrum, corroborating recent hypotheses that indicate autism spectrum symptoms as vulnerability factors for PTSD.

Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance assessed for changes in PTSD symptoms, by DAISI treatment allocation. At the 3-month assessment, participants with PTSD reported significant reductions in PTSD symptoms (except intrusion) and a lower rate of PTSD, and responded better to integrated depression-alcohol misuse CBT than to the alcohol/depression single-focussed or brief interventions.Integrated depression and alcohol misuse CBT may be effective for PTSD symptoms, but intrusions may need to be addressed specifically.",683

Although Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) provides a comprehensive approach to PSTD symptoms, there is no evidence on DTS‐I‐M use in ICU survivors. Aims and objectives To validate the modified intensity Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS‐I‐M) (wherein the frequency and severity subscales are combined to express symptoms intensity) in a convenience sample of ICU survivors in Cyprus, and to explore the prevalence of PTSD symptoms and related predictors. Design An instrument validation design, along with a cross‐sectional, correlational study design was employed. Methods Translation and cultural adaptation of the instrument were achieved through a group of experts and pilot testing. The DTS‐I‐M was administered via telephone. Participants' clinical data (length of ICU stay [LOS], mechanical ventilation duration [MVD], admission diagnosis, medication history) and demographics (age, gender) were collected. Non‐parametric comparisons, and regression analyses to identify predictors of DTS‐I‐M scores and PTSD symptoms were employed. Results The Cypriot DTS‐I‐M version demonstrated high test‐retest (Pearson's r = 0.928, P &lt; .001) and internal consistency (Cronbach's [α] alpha = .97) reliability in a sample of 69 ICU survivors (62.7% response). About 36.2% of participants reported PTSD symptoms. Factor analysis confirmed the construct validity of the DTS‐I‐M, and a 3‐factor structure (encompassing intrusive, avoidance, hyperarousal, mood, and cognitive symptoms). In a multiple regression, MVD (B = −3.11, OR [95% CI] = 22.58 [3.07‐166.09, P = .002]) and LOS ( r 2 = 0.302, P = .002) were statistically significant predictors of DTS‐I‐M score. Conclusion We confirm the applicability of the DTS‐I‐M for the assessment of PTSD symptoms in ICU survivors; and offer preliminary evidence on the prevalence and predictors of post‐ICU PTSD symptoms in Cyprus. Relevance to clinical practice DTS‐I‐M is an appropriate screening tool for PTSD symptoms after ICU hospitalization. Patients with longer MVD and LOS are at higher risk for post‐ICU PTSD symptoms and seem to experience more intense relevant symptoms.",686

We performed a naturalistic, cross-sectional study at two Brazilian centers: the Psychological Trauma Research and Treatment (NET-Trauma) Program at Universidade Federal of Rio Grande do Sul, and the Program for Research and Care on Violence and PTSD (PROVE), at Universidade Federal of São Paulo. Five supervised machine-learning algorithms were tested: Elastic Net, Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and C5.0, using clinical (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale version 5) and sociodemographic features. A hundred and twelve patients were enrolled (61 from NET-Trauma and 51 from PROVE). We found a model with four classes suitable for the PTSD staging, with best performance metrics using the C5.0 algorithm to CAPS-5 15-items plus sociodemographic features, with an accuracy of 65.6% for the train dataset and 52.9% for the test dataset (both significant). The number of symptoms, CAPS-5 total score, global severity score, and presence of current/previous trauma events appear as main features to predict PTSD staging.

Most valuable is identification of prognostic factors that may be reversed by intervention. The mutual maintenance model outlines how post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and pain may be mutually maintained by attention bias, fear, negative affect and avoidance behaviours. In a similar vein, the fear-avoidance model describes how pain-catastrophizing (PCS), fear-avoidance beliefs (FA) and depression may result in persistent pain. These mechanisms still need to be investigated longitudinally in a whiplash cohort.A longitudinal cohort design was used to assess patients for pain intensity and psychological distress after whiplash injury. Consecutive patients were all contacted within 3 weeks after their whiplash injury (n = 198). Follow-up questionnaires were sent 3 and 6 months post-injury. Latent Growth Mixture Modelling was used to identify distinct trajectories of recovery from pain.Five distinct trajectories were identified. Six months post-injury, 64.6% could be classified as recovered and 35.4% as non-recovered. The non-recovered (the medium stable, high stable and very high stable trajectories) displayed significantly higher levels of PTSS, PCS, FA and depression at all time points compared to the recovered trajectories. Importantly, PCS and FA mediated the effect of PTSS on pain intensity.The present study adds important knowledge about the development of psychological distress and pain after whiplash injury. The finding, that PCS and FA mediated the effect of PTSS on pain intensity is a novel finding with important implications for prevention and management of whiplash-associated disorders. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: The study confirms the mechanisms as outlined in the fear-avoidance model and the mutual maintenance model. The study adds important knowledge of pain-catastrophizing and fear-avoidance beliefs as mediating mechanisms in the effect of post-traumatic stress on pain intensity. Hence, cognitive behavioural techniques targeting avoidance behaviour and catastrophizing may be beneficial preventing the development of chronic pain.",688

A pilot randomized controlled study of a brief eye movement desensitization and reprocessing intervention versus reassurance or usual care,"Up to 20% of patients presenting at an emergency room (ER) after a stressful event will for several months suffer from very diverse long-lasting symptoms and a potentially significant decline in quality of life, often described as post concussion-like symptoms (PCLS). The objectives of our randomized open-label single-center study were to assess the feasibility of psychologist-led interventions in the context of the ER and to compare the effect of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) with reassurance and usual care. Conducted in the ER of Bordeaux University Hospital, the study included patients with a high risk of PCLS randomized in three groups: a 15-min reassurance session, a 60-min session of EMDR, and usual care. Main outcomes were the proportion of interventions that could be carried out and the prevalence of PCSL and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) three months after the ER visit. One hundred and thirty patients with a high risk of PCLS were randomized. No logistic problem or patient refusal was observed. In the EMDR, reassurance and control groups, proportions of patients with PCLS at three months were 18%, 37% and 65% and those with PTSD were 3%, 16% and 19% respectively. The risk ratio for PCLS adjusted for the type of event (injury, non-injury) for the comparison between EMDR and control was 0.36 [95% CI 0.20-0.66]. This is the first randomized controlled trial that shows that a short EMDR intervention is feasible and potentially effective in the context of the ER.

It consists of the cognitive restructuring of core trauma-related dysfunctional beliefs about the self and the use of imagery to encourage more functional beliefs. A randomized controlled trial showed that CRIM was effective for reducing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) when it focused on the feeling of being contaminated. For this study, CRIM was adapted to treat PTSD symptoms more generally and after various types of trauma by addressing the patients’ negative self-concept. Ten patients with PTSD received two assessment sessions, two treatment sessions, and a booster session. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was administered prior to and four weeks after treatment. Self-ratings, e.g., the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), were administered at baseline, immediately posttreatment, and four weeks after treatment. The participants showed significant improvements in both clinician-rated (d = 2.55; p < 0.01) and self-reported PTSD symptoms (d = 1.47; p < 0.01). One month after treatment, 9 patients no longer fully met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The results are limited by the small sample size and the lack of a control group. This pilot study suggests that addressing the negative self-concept of PTSD patients using a combination of cognitive techniques and imagery modification can effectively reduce PTSD symptoms. Further research is needed to assess the treatment’s effects and stability in a randomized controlled trial.",690

An examination among typically developing Israeli adults,"Previous research indicates that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face an increased risk of experiencing traumatic events. Autistic Traits (AT), characteristic of ASD, are continuously distributed across the general population. Our main objective was to examine the association between AT and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), a topic rarely assessed before. One hundred and three college students from 3 academic areas, previously found to be associated with different degrees of AT, completed self-report questionnaires tapping PTSD (the PCL-5; PTSD Checklist for DSM-5), AT (AQ; the Autism Spectrum Quotient), and traumatic life events. AT were positively associated with all PTSD symptom clusters, except for avoidance. The association between imagination difficulties and PTSD was moderated by gender. Among participants meeting the PTSD cutoff, those with the highest AT levels reported a PTSD symptomatic profile with an increased dominance of hyper-arousal symptoms. The AT-PTSD association reported here may be attributed to several factors, including increased victimization associated with AT, as well as shared vulnerability factors for both conditions, including impairments in social cognition. Further research is needed in order to understand the associations between these two conditions, considering gender differences, and possible shared underlying mechanisms.",691

Currently, no accurate brief screening for long-term PTSD risk is routinely used in the ED. One instrument widely used in the ED is the 27-item Immediate Stress Reaction Checklist (ISRC). The aim of this study was to develop a short screener using a machine learning approach and to investigate whether accurate PTSD prediction in the ED can be achieved with substantially fewer items than the IRSC.This prospective longitudinal cohort study examined the development and validation of a brief screening instrument in two independent samples, a model development sample (N = 253) and an external validation sample (N = 93). We used a feature selection algorithm to identify a minimal subset of features of the ISRC and tested this subset in a predictive model to investigate if we can accurately predict long-term PTSD outcomes.We were able to identify a reduced subset of 5 highly predictive features of the ISRC in the model development sample (AUC = 0.80), and we were able to validate those findings in the external validation sample (AUC = 0.84) to discriminate non-remitting vs. resilient trajectories.This study developed and validated a brief 5-item screener in the ED setting, which may help to improve the diagnostic process of PTSD in the acute care setting and help ED clinicians plan follow-up care when patients are still in contact with the healthcare system. This could reduce the burden on patients and decrease the risk of chronic PTSD.",692

The objective of this secondary analysis of two clinical trials of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was to determine if hyperarousal symptoms were more resistant to change compared with other PTSD symptom clusters in active duty service members.Service members completed the PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5 (PCL-5) pre- and post-CPT. Symptoms were coded present if rated 2 (moderate) or higher on a 0-4 scale. Cutoffs for reliable and clinically significant change classified 21%, 18%, and 61% of participants as recovered, improved, and suboptimal responders, respectively. Data analyses focused on the posttreatment status of symptoms that were present at baseline to determine their persistence as a function of treatment outcome. Generalized linear mixed effects models with items treated as a repeated measure estimated the proportions who continued to endorse each symptom and compared hyperarousal symptoms with symptoms in other clusters.Among improved participants, the average hyperarousal symptom was present in 69% compared with 49% for symptoms in other clusters (p < .0001). Among recovered patients, hyperarousal symptoms were present for 26%, while symptoms in the reexperiencing (2%), avoidance (3%), and negative alterations (4%) clusters were almost nonexistent (p < .0001).Even among service members who recovered from PTSD after CPT, a significant minority continue to report hyperarousal symptoms while other symptoms remit. Hyperarousal symptoms may require additional treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",693

The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) measured PTS symptoms at 6 months.In orthopaedic patients, 28% had PTS at 6 months, compared with 34% of nonorthopaedic patients. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to determine the influence of pain, physical and mental function, depression, and work status. At 6 months, if the pain score was 5 or higher, the odds of PTS symptoms increased to 8.38 (3.55, 19.8) (P < 0.0001). Those scoring below average in physical function were significantly more likely to have PTS symptoms [OR = 7.60 (2.99, 19.32), P < 0.0001]. The same held true for mental functioning and PTS [OR = 11.4 (4.16, 30.9), P < 0.0001]. Participants who screened positive for depression had a 38.9 (14.5, 104) greater odds (P < 0.0001). Participants who did not return to work after injury at 6 months were significantly more likely to have PTS [OR = 16.5 (1.87, 146), P = 0.012].PTSD is common in patients after injury, including those with orthopaedic trauma. At 6 months, pain of 5 or greater, poor physical and mental function, depression, and/or not returning to work seem to be predictive of PTSD. Orthopaedic surgeons should identify and refer for PTSD treatment given the high incidence postinjury.Prognostic Level I.

In PTSD diagnosis, self-report measures have often been used with a cutoff score to identify those with an elevated likelihood of having PTSD prior to conducting a second-tier diagnostic interview. With an attempt to guide the selection of cutoffs in self-report PTSD measures for various purposes, this study examined how five common criteria for establishing an optimal cutoff influenced the performance of self-report measures for warzone PTSD in relation to the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) and whether the influence differed for the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD. Using a probability sample of Vietnam theater veterans in the National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study, results showed that in both self-report measures, the Youden Index criterion yielded the optimal cutoff that led to better test performance.

Despite increased interest in examining whether PTSD symptom clusters differentially predict suicide-related outcomes, to our knowledge no study has examined this question utilizing a prospective design for which suicide attempts is the outcome. Thus, the present study assessed whether PTSD symptom clusters differentially predict suicide attempts at 3-month follow-up and examined the moderating role of combat exposure.Participants were 758 military service members referred for psychiatric evaluation for suicide-related concerns and who provided both baseline and follow-up data (76.8% male, Mage = 25.20 y [SDage = 6.22 y], 61.6% White/Caucasian, 28.2% combat-exposed). Baseline PTSD symptom clusters scores were derived from an abbreviated version of the PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M). Suicide attempts occurring from baseline to follow-up were assessed with the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview (SASII). Logistic regression models were utilized, controlling for baseline suicide risk severity (i.e., frequency of suicidal ideation, levels of suicidal intent, past suicide plans and attempts) and sociodemographic characteristics.The hyperarousal symptom cluster was the only significant predictor of subsequent suicide attempts and, moreover, this association was significant for combat-exposed service members but not for non-combat-exposed service members.PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, characterized in part by overarousal (e.g., agitation), should be considered in military suicide risk assessment and prevention efforts, particularly for combat-exposed service members.

However, much of this research has been done with cross-sectional samples, often years after trauma exposure, using self-report methodology only, and is focused on intimate relationship adjustment.The current study investigated the longitudinal associations between interpersonal (intimate and non-intimate) relationship functioning and clinician- and self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in 151 recently (within the past 6 months) traumatized individuals. Participants were assessed at four time points over 1 year.Approximately 53% of the sample was diagnosed with PTSD at initial assessment, with declining rates of diagnostic status over time to 16%. Latent difference score (LDS) modeling revealed nonlinear declines in both clinician-assessed and self-reported PTSD symptom severity, with faster declines in earlier periods. Likewise, LDS models revealed nonlinear declines in negative (conflict) aspects of interpersonal relationship functioning, but linear declines in positive (support, depth) aspects. The relationship between PTSD and relationship functioning differed for clinician- and self-reported PTSD. Bivariate LDS modeling revealed significant cross-lagged effects from relationship conflict to clinician-assessed PTSD, and significant cross-lagged effects from self-reported PTSD to relationship conflict over time.These results highlight that the variability in prior results may be related to the method of assessing PTSD symptomatology and different relational constructs.

This study uses a prospective cohort of 108 patients with complete follow-up data including a questionnaire regarding stress symptoms (PCL-S: PTSD checklist specific for a stressor) at 3, 6, and 12 months. The incidence of novel stress symptoms following ICH was approximately 6.5%.

Gender did not affect PTSD symptom development, (t = 1.34, p = 0.18). Pre-morbid functioning, initial stroke prognosis, total number of complications, and length of hospital/ICU stay were not associated with PTSD symptoms; however, each was significantly correlated with poorer functional outcomes. Yet, poorer functional outcomes were observed in those with higher reports of PTSD symptoms (r = 0.24, p = 0.01).

Exposure to potentially traumatizing events, PTSD symptoms and diagnostic status were assessed in 65 children between the ages of 7 and 17 years old. Participants were recruited from a crisis centre for battered women and a school for children with emotional and behavioural problems. The study revealed that Darryl has good internal consistency for the overall scale and adequate reliability for each DSM-IV symptom cluster. Scores from Darryl were significantly correlated with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents (CAPS-CA) scores and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that it could significantly predict the presence of a PTSD diagnosis according to the CAPS-CA. In comparison to the CAPS-CA, Darryl has comparable psychometric properties and assesses PTSD symptoms in a developmentally appropriate manner. Furthermore, Darryl is quick to administer and was easier for the children in this sample to comprehend than the more traditional measure of PTSD. Overall, Darryl is an effective instrument for screening children at risk of a PTSD diagnosis. The relatively high specificity suggests that screening positive for PTSD using Darryl merits further diagnostic assessment. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",699

Identifying factors that predict maintenance of gains after treatment can help triage individuals who may need additional services.Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify classes of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptom trajectories across the year following a 2-week IOP, delivering daily PE for PTSD for post-9/11 Veterans. Predictors of trajectories were examined.Three classes of trajectories best-fit the data for PTSD and depression symptoms. Two classes made up the majority of the sample (85%) and both maintained significantly reduced PTSD symptoms across the year following therapy. For a minority of the sample (14.6%), PTSD symptoms rebounded after treatment. These individuals were highly likely to be categorized in the persistent depression class.IOP-delivered PE is effective, and gains are largely maintained.

Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of the two conditions is often overlooked in clinical settings. Further, little is known about how PTSD is associated with biopsychosocial characteristics in this patient group. The first objective was to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in patients with chronic pain in a Norwegian university hospital outpatient pain clinic. The second objective was to investigate possible associations between PTSS and adverse outcomes such as pain intensity, disability and distress. The third objective was to compare the PTSS prevalence rates between primary versus secondary pain conditions. Materials and methods: 692 patients meeting for pain assessment completed self-report questionnaires about PTSS and possibly associated factors. The Life Events Checklist and the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire were used to screen for potentially traumatic life events. The Impact of Events Scale – Revised and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 were used to assess PTSS. Differences between patients with and without severe PTSS on the possibly associated variables were analyzed by chi-squared- and t-tests. Results: 20,7% of the participants reported a level of PTSS qualifying for a PTSD diagnosis. These patients reported higher levels of pain intensity, pain bothersomeness, disability and psychological distress, as well as lower levels of self-efficacy. They also reported higher levels of pain catastrophizing, perceived injustice, fatigue, and sleep difficulties. Finally, there was not a significant difference in prevalence rates between primary and secondary pain conditions. Discussion: PTSS are frequent in patients with chronic pain, and a range of psychological characteristics is associated with a high level of such symptoms in this patient group. Patients with both conditions report a significantly higher symptom load, and the potential impact on the individual’s life is major. In terms of pain condition, there were no differences in PTSS between primary pain conditions and secondary pain conditions in this pain population. This study emphasizes the importance of increased attention on PTSS when seeing patients with chronic pain conditions in clinical practice.",701

Objective: To examine the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of an intensive treatment programme containing prolonged exposure, EMDR therapy, physical activities and psycho-education, delivered via home-based telehealth. Method: The treatment was carried out within four consecutive days during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of six (four female) patients suffering from severe or Complex PTSD resulting from exposure to multiple traumatic events, mostly during early childhood. Four of them fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of complex PTSD. Outcome measures were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ). Results: CAPS-5 and PCL-5 scores decreased significantly from pre- to post-treatment (Cohen's ds 1.04 and 0.93), and from post-treatment to follow-up (Cohen's ds 0.92 and 1.24). Four of the six patients lost their PTSD or Complex PTSD diagnostic status. No patient dropped out, no personal adverse events and no reliable symptom worsening occurred. Conclusions: The results suggest that intensive, trauma-focused treatment of severe or Complex PTSD delivered via home-based telehealth is feasible, safe and effective, and can be a viable alternative to face-to-face delivered intensive trauma-focused treatment.Antecedentes: La psicoterapia desde la casa entregada por medio de telesalud no ha sido investigada en el contexto del tratamiento intensivo centrado en el trauma para individuos con trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) severo o Complejo.Objetivo: Examinar la factibilidad, seguridad y efectividad de un programa de tratamiento intensivo que contiene exposición prolongada, terapia EMDR, actividades físicas y psicoeducación, entregadas por medio de telesalud desde el hogar.Método: El tratamiento fue llevado a cabo dentro de cuatro días consecutivos durante el brote de la pandemia del COVID-19. La muestra consistió de seis pacientes (cuatro mujeres) que sufrían de TEPT severo o Complejo como resultado de la exposición a eventos traumáticos múltiples, la mayoría durante la infancia temprana.

Undiagnosed PTSD can have detrimental effects on resettlement outcomes. Immigration medical exams provide an opportunity to screen for mental health conditions in refugee and asylum seeker populations and provide links to timely mental health care. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools for PTSD in refugee and asylum seeker populations. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and CINAHL up to 29 September 2022. We included cohort-selection or cross-sectional study designs that assessed PTSD screening tools in refugee or asylum seeker populations of all ages. All reference standards were eligible for inclusion, with a clinical interview considered the gold standard. We selected studies and extracted diagnostic test accuracy data in duplicate. Risk of bias and applicability concerns were addressed using QUADAS-2. We meta-analyzed findings using a bivariate random-effects model. We partnered with a patient representative and a clinical psychiatrist to inform review development and conduct. Our review includes 28 studies (4,373 participants) capturing 16 different screening tools. Nine of the 16 tools were developed specifically for refugee populations. Most studies assessed PTSD in adult populations, but three included studies focused on detecting PTSD in children. Nine studies looked at the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) with diagnostic cut-off points ranging from 1.17 to 2.5. Meta-analyses revealed a summary point sensitivity of 86.6% (95%CI 0.791; 0.917) and specificity of 78.9% (95%CI 0.639; 0.888) for these studies. After evaluation, we found it appropriate to pool other screening tools (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale) with the HTQ. The area under the curve for this model was 79.4%, with a pooled sensitivity of 86.2% (95%CI 0.759; 0.925) and a specificity of 72.2% (95%CI 0.616; 0.808). Our review identified several screening tools that perform well among refugees and asylum seekers, but no single tool was identified as being superior. The Refugee Health Screener holds promise as a practical instrument for use in immigration medical examinations because it supports the identification of PTSD, depression, and anxiety across diverse populations. Future research should consider tool characteristics beyond sensitivity and specificity to facilitate implementation in immigration medical exams. Open Science Framework: 10.17605/OSF.IO/PHNJV",705

In response to accumulating evidence, DSM ‐5 no longer places the same emphasis on dissociative symptoms, and does not require a specific number of any cluster of symptoms for a diagnosis of ASD . Instead, it requires the presence of 9 of any of 14 potential symptoms of ASD , and prohibits the diagnosis until 3 days have elapsed post trauma. Although ASD predicts the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ), relative to trauma‐exposed people who do not develop ASD , most individuals with PTSD do not meet ASD diagnostic criteria prior to the diagnosis of PTSD . Accordingly, the DSM ‐5 diagnosis of ASD intends to describe severe acute reactions rather than predict subsequent PTSD .

Participants were classified into three groups: uncomplicated MTBI (n = 54), injured controls (IC, n = 26), and non-injured controls (NIC, n = 58). Participants completed the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, PTSD Checklist, and Traumatic Brain Injury Quality of Life at baseline (<8 months post-injury) and at follow-up (2–4 years post-injury).Results The prevalence of those who met DSM-IV-TR symptom criteria for Postconcussional Disorder (PCD) was high in all three groups (e.g., 44.8–63.0%) and did not significantly change from baseline to follow-up (all ps>.05). However, there was substantial variability in individual symptom trajectories over time. The majority of participants had symptom trajectories classified as either ‘persistent’ (∼32–55%) or ‘asymptomatic’ (∼30–36%), with a substantial minority classified as ‘improved’ (∼7–12%) or ‘developed’ (∼7–19%). Factors associated with ‘persistent’ PCD trajectories included cognitive complaints, PTSD, depression, anxiety, pain, and headaches at baseline; but not the presence/absence of MTBI. Factors associated with ‘developed’ PCD trajectories included PTSD and the number of lifetime exposures to blast. Conclusions: Reporting of ‘new’ PCSx over time was common in individuals with and without MTBI. It would be erroneous to assume uncritically that PCSx reported many years post-injury reflect only persistent symptomatology, or can be solely attributable to the direct consequences of a brain injury.",707

ICD-11 eliminated several PTSD symptoms thought to be nonspecific, with the goal of reducing psychiatric comorbidities. However, this change also results in a narrower PTSD definition that may fail to capture individuals with clinically significant PTSD. The purpose of the current study was to compare prevalence and psychiatric comorbidities of DSM (IV/5) and ICD-11 PTSD.We evaluated concordance between DSM (IV/5) and ICD-11 PTSD diagnoses in a web survey of two nationally representative samples of U.S. military veterans (ns = 3517 and 1484). Lifetime and past-month PTSD symptoms were assessed with the DSM-IV-based PTSD Checklist-Specific Stressor version and the DSM-5-based PTSD Checklist-5. Psychiatric comorbidities were assessed using MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview modules.A significantly greater proportion of veterans met criteria for lifetime and past-month PTSD under DSM-IV/5 than under ICD-11. 21.8-35.9% of those who met criteria under DSM IV/5 did not meet under ICD-11, whereas only 2.4-7.1% of those who met under ICD-11 did not meet under DSM-IV/5. Psychiatric comorbidities did not significantly differ between DSM-IV/5 and ICD-11.This study relied upon self-report measures of PTSD, distress/impairment, and psychiatric comorbidities.The proposed ICD-11 criteria identify fewer PTSD cases than DSM-IV/5 without reducing psychiatric comorbidities. Veterans with clinically significant PTSD symptoms may not meet ICD-11 PTSD criteria, possibly affecting eligibility for healthcare, disability, and other services. The ICD-11 criteria could be revised to capture more PTSD cases before ICD-11 is published in 2018.",708

Little is known about how these symptoms may change over time. Objectives: We studied changes in PTSD symptoms in family members of critically ill patients with COVID-19 over 12 months. Methods: This prospective, multisite observational cohort study recruited participants at 12 hospitals in five states. Calls were made to participants at 3-4 months, 6 months, and 12 months after patient admission to the intensive care unit. Results: There were 955 eligible family members, of whom 330 (53.3% of those reached) consented to participate. Complete longitudinal data was acquired for 115 individuals (34.8% consented). PTSD symptoms were measured by the IES-6 (Impact of Events Scale-6), with a score of at least 10 identifying significant symptoms. At 3 months, the mean IES-6 score was 11.9 ± 6.1, with 63.6% having significant symptoms, decreasing to 32.9% at 1 year (mean IES-6 score, 7.6 ± 5.0). Three clusters of symptom evolution emerged over time: persistent symptoms (34.8%, n = 40), recovered symptoms (33.0%, n = 38), and nondevelopment of symptoms (32.2%, n = 37). Although participants identifying as Hispanic demonstrated initially higher adjusted IES-6 scores (2.57 points higher [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-4.1; P < 0.001]), they also demonstrated a more dramatic improvement in adjusted scores over time (4.7 greater decrease at 12 months [95% CI, 3.2-6.3; P < 0.001]). Conclusions: One year later, some family members of patients with COVID-19 continue to experience significant symptoms of PTSD. Further studies are needed to better understand how various differences contribute to increased risk for these symptoms.",709

The most common somatic symptoms were trouble sleeping (58.4 and 48.4%), feeling tired or having low energy (52.0 and 46.1%), and stomach pain (45.8 and 45.4%) after three and six months, respectively. Several specific somatic symptoms evaluated three months after the earthquake including trouble sleeping, headache, and shortness of breath were predictors of the overall PTSD symptoms evaluated six months after the earthquake. Additionally, the symptom of hyperarousal evaluated after three months could predict the overall somatic symptoms evaluated after six months.PTSD and somatic symptoms were common after the earthquake, and a longitudinal association between PTSD and somatic symptoms was detected among child and adolescent survivors.

Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted with a sample of 612 BC patients who were currently undergoing treatment. The questionnaire package included Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale (PSS), Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), Network of Relationships Inventory, Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 (GAD‐7), and Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9). Modeling was performed using a latent profile analysis (LPA) to explore patterns of posttraumatic responses among BC patients. Results Based on the fitting indicators of LPA, three‐class patterns model of posttraumatic responses was optimal. Resisting group (34.6%): patients reported mild posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and mild posttraumatic growth (PTG). Growth group (47.4%): patients showed mild PTSS and high PTG. Struggling group (18.0%): patients showed high PTSS and high PTG. BC patients with lower income were more likely to belong to Resisting group and Struggling group. BC patients with high levels of social support were more likely to belong to Growth group. Patients in Struggling group had the highest levels of anxiety and depression. Conclusions This study showed that there was heterogeneity in posttraumatic response patterns of BC patients. The results provided theoretical base guiding the development of health care schemes and psychological interventions for patients, suggesting the necessity of differentiated health care for BC patients with different posttraumatic response patterns.",711

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represented an unheralded opportunity to better understand heterogeneous trajectories of PTSD symptoms across a prolonged period of social disruption and stress. We tracked the PTSD symptoms of trauma-exposed individuals in the U.S., sought to identify population-based variability in PTSD symptom trajectories, and understand what, if any, early pandemic experiences would predict their membership in one trajectory over others. As part of a large-scale longitudinal study of U.S. residents during the pandemic, participants who reported at least one potentially traumatic event in their lifetime (N = 1206) at Wave 1 (April 2020) were included in the current study. PTSD symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 at four time points extending to July 2021. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify heterogeneous symptom trajectories. Trajectory membership was regressed on baseline demographics and experiences from the early stage of the pandemic as measured by the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory. Four trajectories (Resilient [73%], Recurring [13.3%], Recovering [8.3%], and Chronic [5.5%] were identified. Age, trauma load, and early pandemic experiences (emotional/physical health problems and positive changes) were each significant predictors of trajectory membership. Predictors primarily differentiated the Resilient from each of the other three trajectories. Distinct PTSD symptom trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic point to the need for targeted efforts helping those at most risk for ongoing distress.",712

We used data from a randomized controlled trial of 87 participants with PTSD aged 14–21 years. The discriminative ability was evaluated by comparing participants scores on the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L with general population scores. Furthermore, the discriminative ability between subgroups of participants with different disease severity levels was estimated. Correlations between the EQ-5D index and clinical parameters were used to measure construct validity. Test-retest reliability was measured by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between baseline, posttreatment and 3-month follow-up scores of participants with stable symptoms. Finally, the responsiveness of the EQ-5D was calculated by mean differences, effect sizes and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for participants with improved symptoms. Participants reported significantly more problems on the dimensions “mobility”, “usual activities”, “pain/discomfort” and “anxiety/depression” than the general population. The EQ-5D-5L was able to discriminate between different disease severity levels. The EQ-5D index and clinical scales were significantly correlated with absolute values of correlation coefficients varying between 0.21 and 0.59. Furthermore, ICCs between 0.65 and 0.91 indicated good test-retest reliability for the EQ-5D index. The ICCs for the EQ-VAS between baseline and 3-month follow-up, and posttreatment and 3-month follow-up were statistically significant with 0.71 and 0.87, respectively, whereas the ICC between baseline and posttreatment was 0.08 and not statistically significant. Effect sizes to measure the responsiveness ranged between −0.008 and 0.40 for the EQ-5D index and − 0.32 and 0.40 for the EQ-VAS. Furthermore, the area under the curve in ROC analyses was between 0.40 and 0.64 for the EQ-5D index and 0.60 and 0.70 for the EQ-VAS. Discriminative ability, test-retest reliability and construct validity of the EQ-5D-5L were good, whereas the responsiveness was rather weak. Nevertheless, the EQ-5D-5L can be used to measure HrQoL in adolescents and young adults with PTSD.

Many such individuals meet criteria for PTSD while also exhibiting additional symptomology not accounted for in a traditional PTSD diagnosis. This case study provides an overview of the differences between PTSD and CPTSD, using empirical evidence to illustrate the necessity of distinguishing between these two differing diagnoses and subsequently the need for differing treatment approaches. The purpose of this case study is to examine the benefits of using a three-phase, integrative model for an individual with CPTSD. Specifically, it explores the delivery of Courtois and Ford’s (2013) sequenced, relationship-based approach to the treatment of complex trauma. This model was chosen due to the emphasis on attachment and because it allows for clinicians to tailor interventions to the unique individual while also providing an overarching structure to treatment. This treatment analysis is demonstrated via the hybrid case of ""Chloe,” who serves as a meaningful representation of a psychotherapy patient with a history of chronic relational and developmental trauma who presents to treatment with symptoms concurrent with a CPTSD diagnosis. Chloe’s composite case example is based on the author’s actual, de-identified psychotherapy cases in addition to clinical examples in the relevant literature. Using the format of a pragmatic case study (Fishman, 1999, 2013), Chloe’s case is analyzed through qualitative processes and quantitative measures. An in-depth illustration of this hybrid patient’s course of treatment provides an avenue for describing key clinical issues related to the treatment of CPTSD and the utility of an integrative treatment approach. Chloe’s case study is intended to be a resource for clinicians seeking more knowledge and understanding of the impact of chronic developmental and relational trauma and the implications this has for effective treatment.",714

An improved understanding of the relationship between these co-occurring disorders, in addition to effective integrated treatments, will develop by considering the changes to the PTSD diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The current study examined the relationship between the revised PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) symptom clusters (i.e., intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood [NACM], and arousal) and chronic pain measurements (i.e., pain severity, interference, and disability). Materials and Methods Participants included 103 veterans (ages 26-70, mean = 45.33) participating in a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of an interdisciplinary pain management program for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The study was approved by a university system Institutional Review Board and affiliated healthcare system. Results The participants with a provisional PTSD diagnosis based on PCL-5 responses (N = 76) had significantly greater pain severity, interference, and disability than the participants without a provisional diagnosis (N = 23). Correlations between symptom clusters and pain measurements were mostly significant and positive with varying strengths. The avoidance symptom cluster, however, had relatively weaker correlations with pain measurements and was not significantly associated with the numeric rating scale of pain severity. Path analyses revealed that, after controlling for avoidance symptoms, significant associations remained between NACM and all the pain measurements. After controlling for NACM symptoms, however, there were no significant associations between avoidance symptoms and pain measurements. Conclusion The current study highlights a need to re-examine the leading theories about the mutual maintenance of these disorders in order to develop effective integrative treatment approaches. PTSD-related avoidance may have a relatively weaker role in co-occurring chronic pain than the other symptom clusters and may have a qualitatively different role than chronic pain–related avoidance. Future research should explore the relationship between the avoidance in PTSD and the avoidance in chronic pain as well as identify which chronic pain measurements are the most useful when examining the relationship between PTSD and chronic pain. The potential impact of trauma-related cognition and mood on chronic pain indicates that this is an important area for intervention and should be considered in the development of integrated treatments for chronic pain and PTSD among veterans.",715

Yet, few have investigated the heterogeneity of PTSD presentations in this population. This study examined clinically relevant patterns of PTSD symptomatology in aid workers and examined whether factors such as the degree of trauma exposure (e.g., morally injurious events), social support, and sociodemographic and work characteristics predict symptom profiles.Participants were 243 aid workers who had completed 8.2 assignments on average. They completed measures of trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and various types of social support. Latent profile analysis was used to identify PTSD symptom profiles using PCL-5 subscale scores. Next, profiles were compared on 15 potential risk and protective factors.Five profiles were identified: a no PTSD profile (49.4%), a low subclinical PTSD profile (21.8%), a dysphoric subclinical PTSD profile (5.8%), an intermediate clinical PTSD profile (14.8%), and a severe clinical PTSD profile (8.2%). Profiles differed in terms of witnessed traumatic events, morally injurious exposure, social support adequacy, age, number of assignments, types of assignments, and organizational support.This study is the first to identify distinct patterns of PTSD symptomatology in aid workers and to investigate novel psychological risk factors such as potentially morally injurious events. Overall, these findings provide further insight into the risk and protective factors for the psychological well-being of aid workers as well as avenues for improving the psychological assessment and support.

PTSD affects the quality of life and morbidity and may increase health-care costs. Limited access to specialist care results in PTSD patients being treated in primary care settings. Narrative exposure therapy (NET) is based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and has shown positive effects when delivered by health-care professionals other than psychologists. The primary aims of the PICTURE trial (from “PTSD after ICU survival”) are to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of NET adapted for primary care with case management in adults diagnosed with PTSD after intensive care. This is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, primary care-based, randomized controlled two-arm parallel group, observer-blinded superiority trial conducted throughout Germany. In total, 340 adult patients with a total score of at least 20 points on the posttraumatic diagnostic scale (PDS-5) 3 months after receiving intensive care treatment will be equally randomized to two groups: NET combined with case management and improved treatment as usual (iTAU). All primary care physicians (PCPs) involved will be instructed in the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD according to current German guidelines. PCPs in the iTAU group will deliver usual care during three consultations. In the experimental group, PCPs will additionally be trained to deliver an adapted version of NET (three sessions) supported by phone-based case management by a medical assistant. At 6 and 12 months after randomization, structured blinded telephone interviews will assess patient-reported outcomes. The primary composite endpoint is the absolute change from baseline at month 6 in PTSD symptom severity measured by the PDS-5 total score, which also incorporates the death of any study patients. Secondary outcomes cover the domains depression, anxiety, disability, health-related quality-of-life, and cost-effectiveness. The principal analysis is by intention to treat. If the superiority of the experimental intervention over usual care can be demonstrated, the combination of brief NET and case management could be a treatment option to relieve PTSD-related symptoms and to improve primary care after intensive care.

https://openalex.org/W3013114928,,Investigação de traumas e respostas peritraumáticas durante a vida: consequências para a vida adulta,"Often, we are at risk of experiencing traumatic events during our lifetime. In childhood, children may be susceptible to traumatic events, such as physical, emotional and sexual abuse or physical and emotional neglect. These types of trauma can bring a lot of damage to physical, emotional and psychological health. In fact, there is strong evidence in the scientific literature about the various long-term effects of traumatic events that occur in childhood. However, there are still few studies that investigate the influence of peritraumatic responses in childhood and its consequences. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the severity of different types of childhood traumas with (1) the symptomatology of PTSD (2) the tonic immobility (TI) response to trauma in childhood and (3) the tonic immobility response to trauma in adulthood. It was also evaluated whether the TI response to trauma in childhood and in adulthood would be able to predict the symptoms of PTSD. Finally, it was investigated whether the TI response to a trauma in childhood predicts the TI score in adulthood for another trauma. Data collection was performed with 500 college students through questionnaires investigating traumatic events in childhood and adulthood, as well as TI and PTSD symptoms. Analysis of variance were performed to investigate the association between the frequency and severity of different types of traumatic events in childhood with TI responses in childhood, adulthood and severity of PTSD symptoms. Regression analysis were also developed to evaluate if TI responses in childhood would predict TI responses in adulthood and the severity of PTSD symptoms. As the main results of this study, we observed significant associations between the severity of childhood trauma and the posttraumatic symptomatology measured by PCL-5 in adulthood. There was also a significant association between the severity of childhood trauma with TI scores for both childhood and adulthood trauma. Interestingly, the TI score for childhood trauma was significantly associated with posttraumatic stress symptomatology in adulthood. These two results indicate the importance of childhood trauma and the peritraumatic response of TI in childhood to vulnerability to PTSD. A predictive relationship between TI responses for childhood trauma and the TI response to another trauma in adulthood was also identified. Finally, the TI score for adulthood trauma was significantly associated with posttraumatic stress symptomatology in adulthood. These data adds to previous studies showing the relationship of traumatic events in childhood with TI responses and PTSD symptoms. Moreover, it amplifies this idea, suggesting that different types of traumatic events in childhood may influence TI responses in childhood, adulthood and psychopathological symptoms. In addition, they highlight the possibility of predicting future TI responses from an TI response in childhood.",719

Outcomes examined include change in PTSD symptom severity as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and the reliability and clinical significance of change in PTSD symptom severity. Factors examined include patient baseline characteristics, treatment characteristics, and events over follow-up. The mean difference in CAPS score was 38.24 (SE 4.81). Approximately half (49.1%) demonstrated a reliable and clinically significant improvement in PTSD symptom severity. No one was classified as having demonstrated clinically significant worsening of symptoms. Three independent predictors of reductions in PTSD symptom severity were identified: baseline PTSD symptom severity (β 0.77, SE 0.23, p = 0.001), number of traumas experienced prior to baseline (β -0.30, SE 0.15, p = 0.049), and number of sessions attended (β 2.05, SE 0.87, p = 0.024).

Fifteen measures identified as PTSD risk factors in published meta-analyses as well as 12 theoretically and empirically supported individual difference and health-related measures were included in our analysis. Individual difference measures assessed after the trauma, including insecure attachment and factors related to the current trauma memory, such as self-rated severity, event centrality, frequency of involuntary recall, and physical reactions to the memory, accounted for symptom severity better than did measures of pretrauma factors. In an analysis restricted to prospective measures assessed before the trauma, the total variance explained decreased from 56% to 16%.

However, despite myriad studies examining PTSD symptom structure few have assessed the diagnostic implications of these proposed models. This study aimed to generate PTSD prevalence estimates derived from the 7 alternative factor models and assess whether pre-established risk factors associated with PTSD (e.g., transportation accidents and sexual victimisation) produce consistent risk estimates. Seven alternative models were estimated within a confirmatory factor analytic framework using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Data were analysed from a Malaysian adolescent community sample (n = 481) of which 61.7% were female, with a mean age of 17.03 years. The results indicated that all models provided satisfactory model fit with statistical superiority for the Externalising Behaviours and seven-factor Hybrid models. The PTSD prevalence estimates varied substantially ranging from 21.8% for the DSM-5 model to 10.0% for the Hybrid model. Estimates of risk associated with PTSD were inconsistent across the alternative models, with substantial variation emerging for sexual victimisation. These findings have important implications for research and practice and highlight that more research attention is needed to examine the diagnostic implications emerging from the alternative models of PTSD.",724

The primary objective of this study was to explore differences in dissociative experiences (measured with Dissociative Experience Scale, DES) between PTSD and cPTSD according to ICD-11 criteria. Furthermore, we examined relations between total and subscales of dissociation (amnesia, absorption, derealization/ depersonalization) and clinical symptomatological variables of PTSD and cPTSD patients. Results showed that 30 subjects affected by cPTSD had significantly higher DES scores than those 20 affected by PTSD, with large effect sizes. Only DES Amnesia subscale is positively correlated with total Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score, with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score, with Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) Re-Experience subscale and IES-R total score in PTSD sample, while only Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) somatic subscale is related with DES Amnesia subscale and DES Absorption subscale in cPTSD sample.

To investigate the impact of this change on identification of PTSD in young adult cancer survivors (YACS), we compared prevalence of QTE exposure using DSM-5 and earlier DSM-IV criteria.The Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 (SCID-5) was customized for study goals and administered to a convenience sample of 250 YACS ages 18-40 followed at a single cancer center.The SCID-5 was well-tolerated by participants and estimated duration was brief (33 min; range 12-75). Only 35 interviews (14%) presented complex scoring questions. 168 participants (67.2%) identified cancer as their ""most stressful or traumatic experience."" Applying DSM-IV criteria, 227 YACS (90.8%) reported any QTEs; prevalence was significantly reduced following more restrictive DSM-5 QTE criteria, with only 124 YACS (49.6%) reporting ≥1 QTE (z = -9.68, p < 0.001).The SCID-5 can be successfully adapted to assess QTEs in YACS following both DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria. DSM-5 criteria significantly limit prevalence of QTE exposures compared with DSM-IV. As the majority of YACS identify cancer as their most stressful life event, it is critically important to investigate its impact on their psychological functioning. Until more is known about how PTSD symptoms may arise after cancer, clinicians and researchers should adapt PTSD assessments to systematically evaluate the role of cancer as a traumatic event that may lead to PTSD symptoms in YACS.",726

Method Cross-sectional, interview- and assessment-based study. Participants were community-dwelling adults with disabilities resulting from neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (N = 53), who participated in a pre-vocational readiness and social skills training program. The Problem Checklist from the New York University Head Injury Family Interview (PCL), a battery of self-rated and clinician-rated measures of social/emotional status, and neuropsychological tests were main outcome measures. Results PCL is a valid and reliable instrument with acceptable psychometric properties (reliability coefficients for two scales and the total score are above (0.795). Use of maladaptive coping strategies in our sample was reflected in inverse relationship between depression and denial of disability, and in the tendency to overrate self-reported symptoms by participants with acquired trauma. Considerably lower self-ratings of symptoms across all PCL scales were seen in those of our participants who live with parents. Conclusions The study offers initial support for the use of PCL as a measure of long-term functional outcome in individuals with neurological and neuropsychiatric diagnoses. The goal of rehabilitation in patients with long-term disabilities is increase in life satisfaction.Implications for RehabilitationAn important goal of rehabilitation and training programs for individuals with long-term disabilities due to dysfunction of the central nervous system is to improve their quality of life.The HI-FI Problem Checklist (PCL) is a brief and efficient instrument for assessing functional outcomes after long-term disability.This study demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties of the PCL in a sample of 53 individuals participating in a pre-vocational training program and provided initial support for its utility for patients with various diagnoses.",727

Participants were adults admitted to a large Level I Trauma Center for longer than 24 h. Depression was assessed at hospitalization using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), and PTSS was measured by the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD). Hospital outcome information was collected from the hospital's trauma registry. Pearson correlations were performed. 460 participants (mean age = 44 years, SD = 16.8; 65.4% male) completed the study. Baseline PTSS and depression were significantly correlated with longer hospital LOS while controlling for demographics and injury severity (p = 0.026; p = 0.023). Both PTSS-positive and depression-positive groups had an average increased hospital LOS of two days. A significant proportion of individuals who are admitted to the hospital following trauma may be at risk for depression and PTSS, which may then increase hospital LOS. As national attention turns to reducing healthcare costs, early screenings and interventions may aid in minimizing psychiatric symptoms in trauma patients, in turn reducing the cost and outcomes associated with total hospital LOS.",728

The aim of the study was to evaluate the maintenance of treatment gains achieved in a comparative study of effectiveness of prolonged exposure therapy for adolescents (PE-A) and supportive counselling (SC) in adolescents with PTSD up to 24-months post-treatment. Method Sixty-three adolescents (13–18 years) with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either of the interventions comprising 7–14 sessions of treatment provided by trained and supervised non-specialist health workers (NSHWs). The primary outcome measure was PTSD symptom severity, as independently assessed on the Child PTSD Symptom Scale, at pretreatment, post-treatment, and at 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-months post-treatment follow-up (FU) evaluations. Results Participants in both the prolonged exposure and SC treatment groups attained a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms and maintained this reduction in PTSD symptoms at 12- and 24-month assessment. Participants receiving prolonged exposure experienced greater improvement on the PTSD symptom severity scale than those receiving SC at 12-months FU [difference in PE-A v . SC mean scores = 9.24, 95% CI (3.66–14.83), p &lt; 0.001; g = 0.88] and at 24-months FU [difference in PE-A v . SC mean scores = 9.35, 95% CI (3.53–15.17), p = 0.002; g = 0.68]. Conclusions Adolescents with PTSD continued to experience greater benefit from prolonged exposure treatment than SC provided by NSHWs in a community setting 12 and 24 months after completion of treatment.",729

It is therefore important for clinicians to screen for potential symptoms that can be signs of PTSD onset. PTSD in youth is a worldwide problem, thus congruent screening tools in various languages are needed. Objective: The aim of this study was to test the general psychometric properties of the Traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for children and adolescents (UCLA PTSD) Reaction Index for DSM-5 (PTSD-RI-5) in adolescents, a self-report instrument intended to screen for trauma exposure and assess PTSD symptoms. Method: Data was collected from 4201 adolescents in communities within eleven countries worldwide (i.e. Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Indonesia, Montenegro, Nigeria, Palestine-Gaza, Philippines, Portugal, Romania, and Serbia). Internal consistency, discriminant validity, and a confirmatory factor analysis of a four-factor model representing the main DSM-5 symptoms of the PTSD-RI-5 were evaluated. Results: The PTSD-RI-5 total score for the entire sample shows very good reliability (α = .92) as well as across all countries included (α ranged from .90 to .94). The correlations between anxiety/depressive symptoms and the PTSD-RI-5 scores were below .70 indicating on good discriminant validity. The four-factor structure of the scale was confirmed for the total sample and data from six countries. The standardized regression weights for all items varied markedly across the countries. The lack of a common acceptable model across all countries prevented us from direct testing of cross-cultural measurement invariance. Conclusions: The four-factor structure of the PTSD-RI-5 likely represents the core PTSD symptoms as proposed by the DSM-5 criteria, but there could be items interpreted in a conceptually different manner by adolescents from different cultural/regional backgrounds and future cross-cultural evaluations need to consider this finding.",730

Both conditions frequently manifest with attention and working memory deficits, though the underlying neuropsychological basis differs. This study evaluated whether hyperarousal symptoms explain the relationship between subjective and objective measures of cognition in a veteran sample.One-hundred three veterans completed the military version of the PTSD Checklist (PCL), the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, and the Wechsler Memory Scale, 3rd edition digit span task with adequate effort.Hierarchical regression suggested that hyperarousal, but not other PTSD symptoms, explained the relationship between neurobehavioral symptoms and cognitive functioning. This relationship was present regardless of whether veterans met full PTSD diagnostic criteria or screened positive on a traumatic brain injury screener and was robust to other moderators.These findings highlight the importance of considering traumatic brain injury and PTSD symptom overlap, particularly the relationship between hyperarousal symptoms and attention and working memory deficits, in conceptualizing cases and treatment planning.",731

Consistent with other populations, the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for college students has been reported at around 12%. Despite this, empirically supported treatments for PTSD have not been widely disseminated in University Counselling Centers (UCCs). This study examines outcomes using cognitive processing therapy (CPT) with a sample of n = 26 college students in a UCC setting. This study also examines therapist experience, length of degree and symptom severity on outcome. After completing training, n = 8 therapists completed CPT consultation and certification. Students who participated in individual CPT during this process were administered the PCL-5 and PHQ-9 at weekly sessions. A retrospective chart review was completed. PCL-5 and PHQ-9 scores were separately examined as outcome variables using linear mixed models where session, therapist experience, length of therapist degree, and severity of symptoms were included as fixed effects, and subjects were assumed to have a random effect. Significant reductions in PCL-5 and PHQ-9 scores were observed across treatment. In this sample, 84.6% of students were treatment responders. Results were unchanged when adjusting for therapist level of experience or training. CPT shows strong potential for UCC settings. CPT can be successfully implemented with novice therapists.",733

The aim of this study was to extend previous research by investigating whether indicators of functioning can successfully distinguish against symptom response categories derived from the Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL‐5) pre‐ and post‐ PTSD treatment. Participants were 472 veterans receiving hospital‐based treatment for PTSD. In addition to the PCL‐5, measures included quality of life, social relationships, physical health and psychological distress. Four mutually exclusive, progressive response categories were used to define treatment response including: No Response, Response, Response and Below Threshold, and Remission. PTSD symptom reductions were associated with corresponding improvements in broader indicators of functioning. However, it was only when the magnitude of symptom reduction placed the individual in the ‘Response and Below Threshold’ category that improvement on functioning measures achieved levels indicative of a good end state. Traditional metrics of treatment ‘response’ in PTSD treatment do not necessarily indicate recovery on important functioning indicators. Only when an individual both responds to treatment and drops below threshold for probable disorder are they likely to report having meaningful levels of functioning.",734

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence rate of postoperative distress symptoms, namely post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following total hysterectomy for benign disease. We also investigated possible associations between sociodemographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, anxiety, depression, and PTSD.We prospectively enrolled 100 consecutive patients who underwent total hysterectomy for benign disease between 01/01/2019 and 15/04/2019. Demographic and surgical-related characteristics have been registered. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire was administered preoperatively (Time1), postoperatively (Time2), and at follow-up clinical evaluation, between two and three months after surgery (Time3). PTSD was defined based on the results of the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) at Time3.At Time3, the median PCL-5 score was 12,8 (0-70), and 16.4% of patients had PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 > 33). No correlation between sociodemographic or gynecologic characteristics and PTSD was detected. A significant association between depression (HADS > 8) at Time2 (p = 0.002) and Time3 (p < 0.001) and PTSD symptoms was shown.Hysterectomy for benign disease is associated with a non-negligible risk of PTDS; the use of the HADS questionnaires might be useful to select patients who might benefit from dedicated psychological support.",735

First-ever ischemic stroke patients were surveyed 9–13 months after hospitalization at the Charité University Medical Center. Stroke-induced PTSD symptoms were measured using the Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). Prior traumatization together with past PTSD symptoms was assessed retrospectively with the Brief Trauma Questionnaire (BTQ) and the 7-item Short Screening Scale for PTSD. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The Short Form (SF)-36 was used to evaluate physical and mental health outcomes. We received 258 responses from 636 eligible patients (~41%). Based on respondents' scores on the IES-R, the prevalence of probable PTSD due to the stroke event was 11% in our sample. Female sex and younger age were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms. Psychological endpoints did not differ between patients who denied prior trauma exposure and those who reported earlier trauma exposure but denied subsequent PTSD symptoms. However, a history of trauma exposure in tandem with endorsing subsequent PTSD symptoms was linked with significantly increased post-stroke PTSD and depressive symptoms together with decreased psychological well-being. Self-reported physical health did not differ across groups. Younger age, being a woman, and having developed PTSD symptoms in the aftermath of a prior trauma were associated with adverse psychological outcomes after stroke.",736

Debates are still ongoing in the scientific community regarding the conceptual distinction between CPTSD symptoms and those of comorbid PTSD and borderline personality disorder (BPD). The present study aimed to determine whether (a) patterns of symptoms reported by women in a community sample would reveal a CPTSD profile distinct from PTSD and BPD profiles and (b) the resulting profiles could be compared on measures of cumulative childhood trauma exposure, dissociation, and life satisfaction. Women who reported at least one potentially traumatic experience (N = 438) completed questionnaires assessing PTSD, CPTSD, and BPD symptoms. We performed latent profile analyses testing seven models, with the five-profile model emerging as the most appropriate solution. The profiles were characterized as ""high PTSD symptoms"" (12.0%), ""high CPTSD symptoms"" (7.6%), ""high BPD symptoms"" (9.9%), ""high CPTSD and BPD symptoms"" (3.8%), and ""low symptoms"" (66.7%). Group comparisons revealed that the profiles characterized by high CPTSD symptoms, high BPD symptoms, and high CPTSD and BPD symptoms tended to include participants with higher levels of cumulative childhood trauma exposure and symptoms of dissociation and lower ratings of life satisfaction compared to the profiles characterized by high PTSD symptoms and low symptoms, ds = 0.55-1.06.

This provides a unique data source for studying the psychological toll of war. Here, we validate a measure of PTSD ‐symptoms from the questionnaire. Soldiers from two cohorts deployed to Afghanistan with the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) in 2009 ( ISAF 7, N = 334) and 2013 ( ISAF 15, N = 278) filled out a standard questionnaire (Psychological Reactions following International Missions, PRIM ) concerning a range of post‐deployment reactions including symptoms of PTSD ( PRIM ‐ PTSD ). They also filled out a validated measure of PTSD ‐symptoms in DSM ‐ IV , the PTSD ‐checklist ( PCL ). We tested reliability of PRIM ‐ PTSD by estimating Cronbach's alpha, and tested validity by correlating items, clusters, and overall scale with corresponding items in the PCL . Furthermore, we conducted two confirmatory factor analytic models to test the factor structure of PRIM ‐ PTSD , and tested measurement invariance of the selected model. Finally, we established a screening and a clinical cutoff score by application of ROC analysis. We found high internal consistency of the PRIM ‐ PTSD (Cronbach's alpha = 0.88; both cohorts), strong item‐item (0.48–0.83), item‐cluster (0.43–0.72), cluster‐cluster (0.71–0.82) and full‐scale (0.86–0.88) correlations between PRIM ‐ PTSD and PCL . The factor analyses showed adequate fit of a one‐factor model, which was also found to display strong measurement invariance across cohorts. ROC curve analysis established cutoff scores for screening (sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.93) and clinical use (sensitivity = 0.71, specificity = 0.98). In conclusion, we find that PRIM ‐ PTSD is a valid measure for assessing PTSD ‐symptoms in Danish soldiers following deployment.",739

Posttraumatic stress symptoms appear early following trauma, but the relationship between hippocampal volume and PTSD symptom severity during early posttrauma periods is not well understood. It is possible that the inverse relationship between hippocampal volume and PTSD symptom severity is already present soon after trauma. To test this possibility, we prospectively examined the association between hippocampal volumes and severity of PTSD symptoms within weeks to months after trauma due to a motor vehicle collision. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of 44 survivors were collected about 2 weeks and again at 3 months after a motor vehicle collision to measure hippocampal volumes. The PTSD Checklist was used to evaluate PTSD symptoms at each scan time. Full (n = 5) or partial (n = 6) PTSD was evaluated using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale at 3 months. Left hippocampal volumes at both time points negatively correlated with PTSD Checklist scores, and with subscores for re-experiencing symptoms at 3 months. Left hippocampal volumes at 3 months also negatively correlated with hyperarousal symptoms at 3 months. Finally, neither left nor right hippocampal volumes significantly changed between 2 weeks and 3 months posttrauma. The results suggest that small hippocampal volume at early posttrauma weeks is associated with increased risk for PTSD development. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between hippocampal volume and PTSD symptoms at 3 months did not arise from posttrauma shifts in hippocampal volume between 2 weeks and 3 months after trauma.",740

PTSD symptoms related to a traumatic event during the most recent deployment were assessed in four annual waves in 2010–2013 among 682 Reserve Component soldiers. Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) was used to examine the longitudinal trajectories of PTSD symptoms. The association between the PTSD trajectories and suicidal ideation at waves 2 to 4 was examined in logistic regression analyses. Four trajectories were identified: resilience (73.0%), recovery (11.7%), late onset (11.6%) and chronic (3.6%). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated significant differences between trajectories in risk of suicidal ideation. Among the chronic trajectory group, 50.9% reported suicidal ideation (25.8% late onset group; 11.3% recovery group; 4.0% resilience group). After controlling for baseline characteristics, the late onset and chronic trajectory groups were more likely to have suicidal ideation than the resilience and recovery trajectories, respectively. Findings suggest the late onset and chronic trajectories of PTSD symptoms are associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation. They support the importance of follow-up assessment of suicide risk even among individuals with low PTSD symptoms at homecoming.",741

Social cognitive theories posit that behavioral self-blame (i.e., attributing the cause of the assault to personal peri-event behavior) contributes to the etiology and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Yet the direction of the association between self-blame and PTSD symptoms in the acute aftermath of sexual assault is unknown. This study evaluated temporal pathways between behavioral self-blame and PTSD symptom severity in an epidemiological sample of sexual assault survivors ( n = 126) assessed at four time points in the months immediately following the assault. Results of cross-lagged panel modeling revealed that reports of behavioral self-blame at the first assessment following sexual assault predicted PTSD symptom severity at Time 2. However, there was no association between behavioral self-blame at Time 2 and PTSD symptom severity at Time 3, nor was there an association between behavioral self-blame at Time 3 and PTSD symptom severity at Time 4. Instead, PTSD symptom severity predicted behavioral self-blame at Times 3 and 4. Findings suggest that behavioral self-blame following sexual assault may be particularly relevant to the onset of PTSD symptoms, while PTSD symptoms themselves appear to intensify subsequent perceptions of behavioral self-blame. Clinical implications and limitations are discussed.",742

Although women are generally considered at increased PTSD risk, sex and gender differences in PTSD symptom trajectories have not yet been extensively studied.To perform an in-depth investigation of differences in PTSD symptom trajectories across one-year post-trauma between men and women, by interpreting the general trends of trajectories observed in sex-disaggregated samples, and comparing within-trajectory symptom course and prevalence rates.We included N = 554 participants (62.5% men, 37.5% women) from a multi-centre prospective cohort of emergency department patients with suspected severe injury. PTSD symptom severity was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-trauma, using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV. Latent growth mixture modelling on longitudinal PTSD symptoms was performed within the sex-disaggregated whole samples. Bayesian modelling with informative priors was applied for reliable model estimation, considering the imbalanced prevalence of the expected latent trajectories.In terms of general trends, the same trajectories were observed for men and women, i.e. resilient, recovery, chronic symptoms and delayed onset. Within-trajectory symptom courses were largely comparable, but resilient women had higher symptoms than resilient men. Sex differences in prevalence rates were observed for the recovery (higher in women) and delayed onset (higher in men) trajectories. Model fit for the sex-disaggregated samples was better than for the whole sample, indicating preferred application of sex-disaggregation. Analyses within the whole sample led to biased estimates of overall and sex-specific trajectory prevalence rates.Sex-disaggregated trajectory analyses revealed limited sex differences in PTSD symptom trajectories within one-year post-trauma in terms of general trends, courses and prevalence rates. The observed biased trajectory prevalence rates in the whole sample emphasize the necessity to apply appropriate statistical techniques when conducting sex-sensitive research.Antecedentes: Los últimos años han demostrado una mayor aplicación de enfoques prospectivos orientados a la trayectoria para el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT). Aunque generalmente se considera que las mujeres tienen un mayor riesgo de TEPT, las diferencias de sexo y género en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT aún no se han estudiado ampliamente.Objetivo: Realizar una investigación en profundidad de las diferencias en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT a lo largo de un año después de un trauma entre hombres y mujeres, interpretando las tendencias generales de las trayectorias observadas en muestras desagregadas por sexo, así como comparar el curso y la evolución de los síntomas dentro de la trayectoria y las tasas de prevalencia.Método: Incluimos N = 554 participantes (62.5% hombres, 37.5% mujeres) de una cohorte prospectiva multicéntrica de pacientes del servicio de urgencias con sospecha de lesión grave. La gravedad de los síntomas del TEPT se evaluó 1, 3, 6 y 12 meses después del trauma, utilizando la Escala de TEPT administrada por un médico para el DSM-IV. Se realizó un modelo de mezcla de crecimiento latente sobre los síntomas longitudinales de TEPT en las muestras desagregadas por sexo y en la muestra completa. Se aplicó un modelo bayesiano con antecedentes informativos para una estimación confiable del modelo, considerando la prevalencia desequilibrada de las trayectorias latentes esperadas.Resultados: En términos de tendencias generales, se observaron las mismas trayectorias para hombres y mujeres, es decir, resiliente, recuperación, síntomas crónicos y aparición tardía. Los cursos de síntomas dentro de la trayectoria fueron en gran medida comparables, pero las mujeres resilientes tenían más síntomas másque los hombres resilientes. Se observaron diferencias por sexo en las tasas de prevalencia para las trayectorias de recuperación (mayor en mujeres) y de inicio tardío (mayor en hombres). El ajuste del modelo para las muestras desagregadas por sexo fue mejor que para la muestra completa, lo que indica la aplicación preferida de la desagregación por sexo. Los análisis de la muestra completa llevaron a estimaciones sesgadas de las tasas de prevalencia de trayectorias generales y específicas por sexo.Conclusiones: Los análisis de trayectoria desagregados por sexo revelaron diferencias limitadas entre los sexos en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT durante el año posterior al trauma en términos de tendencias generales, cursos y tasas de prevalencia. Las tasas de prevalencia de trayectoria sesgada observadas en el conjunto de la muestra enfatizan la necesidad de aplicar técnicas estadísticas apropiadas al realizar investigaciones que tengan en cuenta el sexo.背景: 近年来, 前瞻性轨迹导向方法在创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 中的应用有所增加。尽管通常认为女性 PTSD 有更高的风险, 尚未对 PTSD 症状轨迹中的性别和性别差异进行广泛研究。目的: 通过解读在性别分类样本中观察到轨迹的一般趋势, 以及比较轨迹内症状过程和流行率, 对创伤后一年内 PTSD 症状轨迹的男女差异进行深入考查。方法: 我们纳入了 N= 554 名参与者 (62.5% 男性, 37.5% 女性), 这些参与者来自多中心前瞻性队列疑似严重受伤的急诊科患者。在创伤后 1, 3, 6 和 12 个月, 使用DSM-IV临床用 PTSD 量表评估 PTSD 症状严重程度。在性别分类样本和整个样本中对纵向 PTSD 症状进行了潜在增长混合模型。考虑到预期潜在轨迹的流行率不平衡, 应用了具有信息先验的贝叶斯模型进行可靠模型估计。结果: 就总体趋势而言, 男性和女性观察到相同的轨迹, 即韧性, 恢复, 慢性症状和延迟发作组。轨迹内的症状过程在很大程度上具有可比性, 但韧性组女性比韧性组男性有更高的症状。在恢复组 (女性较高) 和延迟发病组 (男性较高) 轨迹中观察到流行率的性别差异。性别分类样本的模型拟合优于整个样本, 表明首选应用性别分类。对整个样本的分析导致对总体和特定性别轨迹流行率估计有偏。结论: 性别分类轨迹分析揭示了创伤后一年内 PTSD 症状轨迹在总体趋势, 病程和流行率方面的性别差异有限。在整个样本中观察到的有偏轨迹流行率强调了在进行性别敏感性研究时应用适当统计技术的必要性。.",743

 Materials and methods: This research was conducted on 100 participants, namely war veterans treated from PTSD in the Regional Centre for Psychotrauma and the Department of Psychiatry of the University Hospital Split. Measuring instruments used for this research are CAPS V (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) and ITQ (International Trauma Questionnaire). CAPS V was used to diagnose PTSD and to evaluate the intensity and frequency of symptoms, while ITQ was used to specifically diagnose complex PTSD. Of the original 100 participants, 73 of them met the criteria for diagnosis and gave the complete data.
 Results: The intensity of symptoms was higher in veterans with complex PTSD (46,1 ± 10,36) than the intensity in veterans with PTSD (39,5 ± 11,87), and this difference was statistically significant. The frequency of symptoms was also higher in veterans with complex PTSD (15,5 ± 2,38) than the frequency in veterans with PTSD (14 ± 3,11), which was also statistically significant. The greatest statistically significant difference was determined in the intensity (P=0,002) and frequency (P=0,001) of the arousal symptoms.
 Conclusion: Veterans with complex PTSD develop symptoms of higher intensity and frequency than veterans with PTSD, which proved to be of statistical significance. No statistically significant difference was determined in relation to the sociodemographic characteristics (age, year of first diagnosis, employment status, years of employment) between veterans with PTSD and those with complex PTSD.",744

A sample of 1,278 Chinese adolescents (54.0% girls) with a mean age of 13.4 years (SD = 0.8, range = 12-16) completed 2-wave surveys 2.5 and 3.5 years after a major disaster. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV, the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children, and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. Latent class analyses identified 4 classes characterized by high, reexperiencing/hypervigilance, dysphoria, and low symptoms, respectively at each time point. Latent transition analyses revealed relatively high levels of temporal stability within low symptom and dysphoria classes but relatively high probabilities of migration from re-experiencing/hypervigilance and high symptom classes into lower symptom classes. Multinomial logistic regression analyses found that some of the between-class movements during the year were predicted by baseline distress or fear disorders. This study provides an initial depiction of both quantitative and qualitative changes in youth's long-term PTSD symptom patterns over time and gives a further elucidation of other forms of posttrauma psychopathology's impacts on PTSD course. These findings carry implications for ongoing evaluation and adjustable intervention individually tailored to youth's PTSD manifestations and comorbidities in the long-term disaster aftermath.",745

With the release of the new ICD-11 diagnostic guideline for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD), this issue warrants further attention. In the current study, we provide a preliminary assessment of the associations between ICD-11 CPTSD and dissociative experiences. This study is based on a sample (N = 106) of highly traumatized clinical patients from the United Kingdom who completed measures of traumatic stress and dissociative experiences. The majority of participants met the diagnostic criteria for CPTSD (69.1%, n = 67), with few patients qualifying for a diagnosis of PTSD (9.3%, n = 9). Those with CPTSD had significantly higher levels of dissociative experiences compared to those with PTSD (Cohen’s d = 1.04) and those with no diagnosis (Cohen’s d = 1.44). Three CPTSD symptom clusters were multivariately associated with dissociation: Affective Dysregulation (β = .33), Re-experiencing in the here and now (β = .24), and Disturbed Relationships (β = .22). These findings indicate that dissociative experiences are particularly relevant for clinical patients with CPTSD. Future longitudinal work will be needed to determine if dissociation is a risk factor for, or outcome of, CPTSD.",746

The co-occurrence of PC and PTSD symptoms after mTBI in relation to health-related quality of life (HRQoL), health care utilization, and return to work has not yet been investigated. PC and PTSD symptoms were measured six months post-TBI by respectively the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Of the 1566 individuals after mTBI who met the inclusion criteria, 26.1% experienced PC symptoms (RPQ ≥16). Additionally, 9.8% experienced PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 ≥ 33), of which the vast majority (81%) also reported experiencing PC symptoms. Differences between patients with no/mild symptoms, with only PC, only PTSD, and both PC and PTSD symptoms in HRQoL, return to work, and rehabilitation were analyzed using logistic and linear regression analyses. Patients with PC and/or PTSD symptoms reported lower HRQoL, higher rates of rehabilitation, and lower return to work rates compared to patients with no/mild symptoms. Patients with both PC and PTSD symptoms reported significantly lower HRQoL (B = −2.73, CI = −4.65; −0.83, p &lt; 0.001) compared to those with only PC symptoms, while there were no significant differences in their ongoing rehabilitation care (OR = 1.39, CI = 0.77–2.49, p = 0.272) and return to work rates (OR = 0.49, CI = 0.15–1.63, p = 0.246) at six months. These results underline the importance of the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of patients with mTBI, experiencing PC and/or PTSD symptoms.",747
https://openalex.org/W4239499642,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2015.03.021,Adverse childhood experiences and associations with self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms in young adults,"The PTSD diagnosis and latent structure were substantially revised in the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5. However, three alternative models (i.e., anhedonia model, externalizing behavior model, and hybrid model) of PTSD fit the DSM-5 symptom criteria better than the DSM-5 factor model. Thus, the psychometric performance of the DSM-5 and alternative models’ PTSD factor structure needs to be critically evaluated. The current study examined whether gender or trauma directness (i.e., direct or indirect trauma exposure) moderates the PTSD latent structure when using the DSM-5 or alternative models. Model performance was evaluated with measurement invariance testing procedures on a large undergraduate sample (n=455). Gender and trauma directness moderated the DSM-5 PTSD and externalizing behavior model and did not moderate the anhedonia and hybrid models' latent structure. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.",748
https://openalex.org/W2567295442,,Meaning and Resilience as Predictors of Posttraumatic Growth Among College Students,"Meaning in life is related to such outcomes as resilience and the potential to experience posttraumatic growth among populations that have experienced a traumatic event. However, the literature is conflicted on the relationship between resilience and posttraumatic growth. The goal of this study is to further evaluate the relationship between meaning, resilience, and posttraumatic growth among a college student sample. Six-hundred and twelve participants, ages 18-26, completed self-report measures about their experience with potentially traumatic events (Life Events Checklist), their perceived purpose in life (Purpose in Life test – Short Form), resilience (Brief Resilience Scale), and posttraumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory – Short Form). After data cleaning, five-hundred and thirteen participants indicated experiencing at least one potentially traumatic event. Using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist – Civilian form (PCL-C), two subsamples of 99 and 414 participants who scored above and below the diagnostic threshold for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively, were used to calculate additional results. The hypotheses examined included the following: 1) meaning and resilience scores would be positively correlated; 2) meaning scores would be predictive of posttraumatic growth; 3) meaning would be a stronger predictor of posttraumatic growth scores than resilience; and 4) posttraumatic growth and posttraumatic stress scores would be positively correlated. The results supported these hypotheses. Meaning and resilience had a medium positive correlation (r = .354, p < .001) in the total sample, with similar scores in both subsamples. In the overall sample (F(1, 512) = 9.624, p < .01, R2 = .018) and with individuals scoring below the diagnostic threshold for PTSD (F(1, 413) = 3.586, p = .059, R2 = .007), meaning played a small, significant role in predicting posttraumatic growth. Though in the portion of the sample that exceeded the diagnostic threshold for PTSD, that role was much larger (F(1, 99) = 19.528, p < .001, R2 = .165). Resilience had a slightly negative relationship with posttraumatic growth (r = -.08, p < .035), but in the overall sample resilience enhanced the effect of meaning on posttraumatic growth (F(2, 511) = 9.326, p < .001, R2 = .035), nearly doubling it. Below the cutoff meaning was not significantly predictive of posttraumatic growth (F(1, 413) = 3.568, p = .059, R2 = .007) and resilience had a slightly positive relationship (F(1, 98) = 3.878, p < .05, R2 = .007) and made up .7% of the predictive value, but measured with resilience this increased to 1.9% (F(2, 511) = 5.012, p < .01, R2 = .019) Above the cutoff meaning and resilience measured together had the same result of 16.5% of the predictive value, which is identical to meaning measured independently (F(2, 98) = 19.528, p < .001, R2 = .165). Additionally, in the total sample there was a small and significant correlation between posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth (r = .163, p < .001), but this became insignificant among the sample which exceeded the diagnostic threshold for PTSD on the PCL-C (r = .006, p = .954). The results of this study suggest that meaning is related to both resilience and posttraumatic growth, and should be further studied to understand the role it may play in enhancing both. Implications of the study and future research directions are discussed.",749
https://openalex.org/W3008323568,10.1080/20008198.2020.1716593,Complex PTSD among treatment-seeking veterans with PTSD,"Background: In the ICD-11 hierarchical classification structure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) are separate and distinct but also ‘sibling’ disorders, meaning that the diagnoses follow from the parent category of traumatic stress disorders.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of CPTSD in treatment-seeking war veterans with PTSD more than 20 years after the exposure to cumulative war-related trauma(s). The second aim was to examine if there was an association between demographic and psychosocial variables and CPTSD or PTSD.Method: A sample of 160 male war veterans with PTSD referred to the outpatient service of the PTSD Referral Centre at the Clinical Hospital Centre (CHC) Rijeka participated in a cross-sectional study. Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and participants completed validated self-report measures: The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ).Results: In total, 80.63% of the sample met criteria for a probable diagnosis of CPTSD. The study revealed that there was no significant difference in the length of deployment, in the intensity of the PTSD symptoms, types of trauma exposure and pharmacotherapeutic treatment between PTSD and CPTSD group. It was found that veterans with PTSD were more likely to be divorced and to participate in PTSD clubs. On the other hand, veterans with CPTSD were significantly more likely to have higher levels of functional impairment and comorbidity with general anxiety disorder (GAD) compared to the PTSD group.Conclusions: This study supports the proposition that a prolonged trauma of severe interpersonal intensity such as war is related to high rates of CPTSD among treatment-seeking veterans, years after the war. The distinction between PTSD and complex PTSD may help the selection of person-centred treatment interventions that would target specific mental health and functional problems in patients.",750
https://openalex.org/W4323670169,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14211,“Psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the post-traumatic growth inventory with university students in Jordan,"Post-traumatic Growth plays a key role to cope with traumatic incidents. The scale for Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) has been used by several researchers in different languages. This study aims to evaluate the Arabic-translated version of the PTGI scale by focusing on its validity in different languages and contexts. This study introduces an Arabic version of the PTGI-M normed with 417 undergraduate students at a large university in Jordan. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest reliability of the instrument were 0.97 and 0.82, respectively. Bivariate correlation was used to approximate the concurrent validity (CV). Significant correlations were found between the PTGI-M and the beck depression inventory (BDI), perceived stress scale (PSS), Taylor's manifest anxiety (TMAS), satisfaction with life (SWL), and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the translated scale. Convergent and discriminant validity was established for the Arabic version of the PTGI-M by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In conclusion, this study proposes that future investigations should consider analysing the total PTGI-M subtotal scores to comprehend the complexity of the post-traumatic growth experience.",751
https://openalex.org/W3094210636,10.1002/acr.24228,Measures of Psychosocial Stress and Stressful Exposures,"This article presents a summary of selected self-report measures that are considered most relevant to the assessment of psychological stress among adult patients and research participants in the context of rheumatology clinical and/or research practice (Table 1). Measures that accurately capture stress exposures and perceptions are relevant to the rheumatology community for several reasons. First, patients with rheumatic conditions frequently identify stressful events as triggers for disease flares or worse symptoms burden 1. Second, there is growing evidence that psychosocial stress may confer increased risk of developing autoimmune conditions or more severe/active disease among patients who have already been diagnosed. For example, prior studies have shown an association of daily stressors and stress vulnerability with changes in stress hormones and worse disease severity among patients with rheumatoid arthritis 2-6. There is also data from large national cohort studies that demonstrate independent associations of prior trauma and trauma-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with subsequent incident rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, even after adjusting for important covariates such as race, socioeconomic status (SES), and health-related behaviors 7-9. Third, there is biologic plausibility to support a link between stress and autoimmune conditions, given the known effects of physiologic stress response systems such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on inflammatory pathways 10. In order to capture its multidimensional nature, a thorough assessment of psychological stress is best captured with multiple validated instruments that collectively measure both stressful exposures and stress perceptions. This review therefore addresses measures designed to capture exposure to specific stressful events as well as the individual's appraisal of them, and it includes the following instruments: the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Questionnaire, the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ), the Life Events List (LEL), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Instruments included in this review were selected to cover the following four major types of stress: stress experienced during childhood, prior exposure to trauma, exposure to general (nontraumatic) life events, and the respondents’ appraisal of the degree to which their life circumstances are stressful. For each of the four types of stress, we selected the instrument that would be most reliable and useful based on several criteria, including whether prior studies have demonstrated adequate psychometric performance, prior use in clinical research, availability of normative data, associated burden to respondents (time to complete), and ease of scoring/interpretation (Tables 1 and 2). In most cases, we were not able to identify a single instrument that performs well on all criteria considered, in which case we selected instruments with favorable performance across most of the criteria. This review is not intended to be exhaustive; it focuses on self-report measures and does not include measures of physiologic stress or stress biomarkers. Although two of the instruments we reviewed query respondents regarding prior exposure to trauma, they are not intended to diagnose or treat trauma-related conditions such as PTSD. The decision to diagnose a psychiatric illness should be made by trained mental health professionals and is beyond the scope of this review. Finally, given the sensitive nature of the questions included in several of the instruments, some respondents may experience and express an emotional response while answering them. Therefore, if used as part of a research study, we recommend that investigators provide study interviewers with a protocol and script to reference in the event that respondents express emotional distress while answering questions, including contact information for appropriate mental health resources. To measure general stress perceptions and the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items assess the respondent's global level of perceived stress over the last month, including the degree to which they find life unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading 11. The original version of the PSS includes 14 items. There are two validated iterations with ten items and four items, respectively. Five-point scale in which 0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, and 4 = very often. For the 14-item PSS form (PSS-14), scores range from 0 to 56; for the ten-item PSS form (PSS-10), scores range from 0 to 40; and for the four-item PSS form (PSS-4), scores range from 0 to 16. The past month. The PSS is free to use. Permission for use is not necessary when use is for nonprofit academic research or nonprofit educational purposes. The PSS-14 can be found in Appendix A of the original publication by Cohen et al 11. The PSS-4 and PSS-10 are available for download at the following URL: https://www.cmu.edu/dietr​ich/psych​ology/​stress-immun​ity-disea​se-lab/scale​s/index.html. Easily self-administered or administered by an interviewer. Can be administered in person, in written or interview format, by telephone interview, or by mail. PSS scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the positive items (0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1, and 4 = 0) and then summing across all items. For the PSS-14, items 4 to 7, 9 to 10, and 13 are the positively stated items. Higher scores indicate greater perceived stress. The PSS was not developed to be used as a diagnostic instrument, and there are no score cutoffs, only comparisons within the study sample. Normative data exist for the PSS-4, PSS-10, and PSS-14 from 2387 respondents in a US probability sample collected by the Harris Poll in 1983, including mean and SD scores by sex, occupation, income, race, and ethnic background 12. The mean (SD) scores for the PSS-14 by sex were 18.8 (6.9) for men and 20.2 (7.8) for women; the PSS-10 scores were 12.1 (5.9) for men and 13.7 (6.6) for women. More recent national normative data for the PSS-10 are available from questionnaires administered in 2006 and 2009, which showed greater reported stress among women, younger adults, and those of lower SES 13. Approximately 5 minutes. Minimal. When self-administered, a pencil or pen are needed to complete. Five minutes or fewer. There are two abbreviated adaptations that were developed and validated by Dr. Sheldon Cohen. The PSS-10 12, 13 has become the most commonly used adaptation; and the PSS-4 11 can be made from questions 2, 4, 5, and 10 of the PSS-10 item scale. The questionnaire has been translated in at least 25 languages, many of which are available for download (https://www.cmu.edu/dietr​ich/psych​ology/​stress-immun​ity-disea​se-lab/scale​s/index.html). Floor and ceiling effects were not pretested during original development, but subsequent studies of other samples have indicated negligible ceiling or floor effects 14. Cronbach's α correlations for the PSS-14 from samples tested in the original publication were high (r = 0.84-0.86) 11. A meta-analysis of the PSS psychometric properties found that Cronbach's α was greater than 0.70 (the established cutoff for minimum measure of internal consistency) for both the PSS-14 and PSS-10 in all studies in which it was evaluated. In contrast, the reported Cronbach's α was below the acceptable cutoff in half of the six studies in which the PSS-4 was evaluated 15. Correlations over 2 days (r = 0.85) and 4 weeks suggest that PSS scores reflect stable individual differences during short time intervals, whereas the test-retest reliability was not satisfactory when studied over an interval of 6 weeks (r = 0.55). There is no established gold standard for the PSS, which complicates the ability to assess validity. The PSS was strongly correlated with the mental component of health status as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 16. In the original publication, Cohen et al reported that the PSS-14 “correlated in the expected manner with a range of self-report and behavioral criteria” 11. The PSS-10 has been found to correctly classify patients as improved or unchanged according to the patient's own judgement 17. In a study of the Danish version of the PSS-10 tested among Danish people with work-related stress, the estimates for minimal clinically important change were 11 points for the absolute change score and 28% for the relative change score 17. The PSS has been used to measure changes in self-report stress in a variety of nonpharmacologic stress-reduction interventions, including mindfulness interventions for caregivers 18-20, and as a secondary outcome in a physical activity intervention for fibromyalgia 21. The PSS is easy to use and requires relatively minimal time from respondents. It has established acceptable psychometric properties and normative data from large samples of US residents. The PSS may not be generalizable to certain patient populations, including those with less education (less than a high school degree) and under-represented racial/ethnic groups. Although the psychometric properties were favorable for the PSS-14 and PSS-10, the internal consistency of the PSS-4 was only marginally acceptable. The PSS has unclear application in clinical practice because no established cutoffs have been developed to predict subsequent development of clinical psychiatric disorders or differential health outcomes. The PSS is useful for research studies that aim to measure appraised stress in relationship to treatments and/or clinical outcomes among patients with rheumatic conditions. Given the widespread use of the PSS in prior stress research and the presence of normative data, there is an ability to compare scores observed in future studies with data from a variety of clinical and healthy populations. To measure the incidence of different types of traumatic exposure during childhood (first 18 years of life). The items assess prior history of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; neglect; domestic violence; and dimensions of household dysfunction, ranging from exposure to substance abuse and mental illness to parental separation and divorce. The most common version of the ACE tool is 10 items; however, several other versions exist. For example, in 2018, the World Health Organization created the ACE-International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) to better capture exposures that occur in low- and middle-income countries, including community violence. The ACE-IQ includes 29 items 22. Dichotomous (yes/no). Varies by version. The adult version is an individual self-report of exposures during the first 18 years of life. However, versions that utilize parent/caregiver report also exist to assess exposure among minors; those versions query caregivers regarding the period from birth until the present in the dependent's life. The ACE Questionnaire is free to use. We recommend the current Adverse Childhood Events Revised Questionnaire, which can be found at the following URL: https://www.acesa​ware.org/scree​n/scree​ning-tools/. Written, paper and pencil, interviewer, and computer-based administration. Scores range from 0 to 10 on the standard ACE Questionnaire. Higher scores indicate more exposure to different adverse events in the first 18 years of life. Approximately 5 minutes, possibly faster depending on the population and burden of exposures. Low burden outside of health care setting. If administered to parents/caregivers of a child within a health care setting, the burden may increase if exposures trigger services. The ACE Questionnaire has been translated into multiple languages, including Spanish, German, French, Norwegian, and Swedish. There is a validated short form ACE screener that shows strong convergent validity with the full ACE measure and was similarly related to the health outcomes. The short form ACE screener is made up of two items assessing exposure to household alcohol abuse and emotional abuse. Several other versions of the ACE Questionnaire exist, including the ACE-IQ, the ACE from the Center for Youth Wellness, the Philadelphia ACEs, the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being, the National Survey of Children's Health-ACEs, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System-ACEs. They range in content but generally incorporate the standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Kaiser ACEs questions, use similar methodology, and demonstrate consistent associations with worse health outcomes 23. Floor and ceiling effects have not been explicitly investigated; however, because ACEs occur more frequently in certain populations, including low SES populations, such effects are possible. Several studies report a modest to good test-retest reliability period 24, 25. Similarly, the internal consistency of the ACE items is generally moderate to high 26. The ACE measure shows good construct validity because it shows strong correlations with other childhood trauma measures 27. This is a measure of childhood exposures and is not appropriate for responsiveness psychometrics. This is a measure of exposure not response. This measure appears to be generalizable, although cultural considerations are warranted when using this measure to predict future health outcomes. Similarly, there may be sensitive periods in development when exposures are more meaningful that are not traditionally captured in the standard ACE measure, possibility limiting its generalizability. Several clinical trials have been conducted in which participants report ACEs, or in which the ACEs score is hypothesized as a moderator. However, ACEs have not been tested as a primary outcome in a clinical trial setting. The ACE Questionnaire can be easily administered quickly and at low cost. The ACE score is predictive of future mental and physical health problems and can theoretically be administered in childhood, adolescence, and in adulthood. Of note, administration in childhood typically relies on responses from the parent/caregiver. The primary concern has historically been recall bias of trauma in childhood. However, a recent study demonstrated modest correlation (r = 0.47) and convergent associations with health outcomes, the caveat being that data from the study suggested that personality characteristics (eg, neuroticism) may bias retrospective reports 28. This measure appears to be useful in predicting disease risk and has been linked with inflammatory responses relevant to rheumatic disease 29, 30. As such, ACE scores may be useful in stratifying risk of disease incidence and progression; however, this is yet to be empirically tested. To measure lifetime exposure to stressful and potentially traumatic events in general, community, and clinical populations. The THQ covers a broad range of stressors and potentially traumatic events that meet Criterion A of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Criterion A includes situations in which a person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event involving a threat to the physical integrity of the self or others. Criterion A does not include symptoms or responses related to the event 31. THQ items ask respondents about 24 different and prevalent types of stressful and traumatic experiences, including crime, general disaster, and physical and sexual assault 32. The THQ is a 24-item self-report measure. Respondents are asked whether each event ever happened to them (yes/no). For each event endorsed, respondents are asked to provide qualitative details about the event, the frequency of the event, and their approximate age at the time of the event. Entire lifetime. The THQ is free to use. Permission for use is not necessary when use is for nonprofit academic research or nonprofit educational purposes. All language versions are available for download at the following URL: https://ctc.georg​etown.edu/toolk​it/. The THQ can be easily administered as a self-report instrument or in an interview format. It can be administered in person, by written or interview format, by telephone interview, by mail, or electronically. The THQ is a data collection instrument not a test, so there is no standard scoring method. However, the most common scoring convention is to generate a total score representing the numbers and types of events endorsed by summing all items 33, 34, which can range from 0 to 24. A researcher or clinician can also generate subscale scores, calculated by summing items associated with crime-related events (four items; range: 0-4), general disaster and traumatic events (13 items; range: 0-13), and physical and sexual experiences (six items; range: 0-6). The final item allows for reports of traumatic experiences not covered in the other statements and is not usually scored unless the provided response contains relevant information not pertaining to the other items. Other researchers have dichotomized the total trauma score to classify participants as low or high trauma 35, 36. For example, Spertus et al grouped participants who reported no traumatic events or only one kind of event as low trauma and participants who reported two or more kinds of traumatic events as high trauma 35. Higher scores on the total trauma score and subscale scores indicate greater exposure to stressful and traumatic events 32. Consistent with other trauma history instruments, there is no standard scoring system; thus, no normative data have been published. The self-report paper-and-pencil format takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Administering it as an interview takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes depending on the number and types of trauma-exposed events the person endorses. Minimal. When self-administered, a pencil, pen, or electronic report form are needed. Minimal training time to score; approximately 5 to 10 minutes. The THQ has been culturally adapted and translated into Portuguese 37, Spanish 38, Hebrew 39, Kurdish 40, French, Danish, Urdu, Icelandic, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Many of these translated versions are available for download (see How to obtain). Researchers have not evaluated floor or ceiling effects for the total trauma or subscale scores of the THQ. In the original study testing the psychometric properties of the THQ 41, stability coefficients over 2 to 3 months ranged from 0.47 to 0.91 for the reporting of specific traumatic events (yes/no). The correlation for the number of items endorsed across administrations was r = 0.70, indicating adequate reliability. In a study administering the THQ as an interview with a small sample of psychiatric outpatients, researchers found κ coefficients ranging from 0.57 to 0.89 across 7 days for events endorsed by at least 20% of the sample 42. Mueser et al also found excellent consistency among three interviewers rating audiotaped interviews, with κ coefficients ranging from 0.76 to 1.00 for events endorsed by at least 20% of participants 42. Face and content validity were established in the development of the THQ by including items that correspond with DSM examples of Criterion A stressors. In a small sample, items on the THQ were compared with those on the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire. The authors found high variability in κ coefficients (ranging from 0.13-1.00), indicating adequate convergent validity for several items 43. Scores on the THQ were also significantly positively correlated with scores on the Conflict Tactics Scale (r = 0.46), which measures intrafamily conflict and violence 44. THQ scores for the total number of traumas and the type of trauma have been significant predictors of rates of PTSD and PTSD symptomatology 45. THQ scores have also been significantly positively related to depression and personality disorders and inversely related to resilience and mental health functioning 46. This instrument is a checklist of stressful and traumatic event exposure and not a measure of symptom severity following exposure, which would change over time. Thus, there have been no studies that sought to determine the responsiveness or minimally important differences of the THQ. The THQ has been used in samples of college students, people with severe mental illness, pregnant women, individuals with substance dependence, police officers, people with epilepsy, and people with lower income, among many others. It has been used by researchers in the United States and internationally to assess trauma and stressor exposure. Thus, results derived from use of the THQ are generalizable to several demographic groups and cultures. It may not be generalizable to specific clinical groups for which it has not yet been validated. The THQ, similar to other stressful life event inventories, is not intended to measure change over time in the context of a randomized controlled trial. Thus, it has mostly been administered at baseline in clinical trials to classify the proportion of the sample that has experienced certain trauma or meets the criteria for PTSD 47. The THQ is easy to administer and requires minimal time from respondents. Across a range of both national and international studies, the THQ appears to be a reliable and valid questionnaire for assessing trauma and stress exposure in clinical and nonclinical samples. Findings about the psychometric properties of this measure are preliminary; most of the studies assessing reliability and validity were in small samples that may not be generalizable (eg, primarily white patients with severe mental illness). Further, the test-retest reliability ranges from fair to excellent across different types of events, with higher reliability for the total number of events endorsed compared with individual items. This instrument is potentially useful to mental health providers to screen for prior trauma exposure that could impact mental and/or physical health. However, it is not endorsed as a tool to diagnose or treat clinical conditions such as PTSD and has low direct clinical usability to practicing rheumatologists. The THQ is useful for research studies that aim to assess lifetime exposure to events that are considered stressful and potentially traumatic in relationship to physiological stress reactivity, health behaviors, and clinical outcomes such as onset of autoimmune conditions and/or autoimmune disease severity. To assess the occurrence of major life events in the past 12 months. The measure is composed of major life events, both positive and negative, experienced by the person completing the questionnaire (ie, self) and/or someone with whom they are close. These events include a broad spectrum of experiences, including relocation, interpersonal loss (eg, romantic breakup), job loss or gain, marriage, new baby, death of a loved one, and significant change in finances. The LEL contains 26 event items (23 specified events and three optional events). For items that are endorsed as occurring, there are follow-up questions to determine whether the event was perceived as positive or negative, who experienced the event (self vs close other), and additional contextual information. Event occurrence is assessed as yes/no. Follow-up question response scales are specific to the particular event. Past 12 months. The LEL is free to use. Permission for use is not necessary when use is for nonprofit academic research or nonprofit educational purposes. The LEL is available on the author's university website at the following URL: https://www.cmu.edu/dietr​ich/psych​ology/​stress-immun​ity-disea​se-lab/scale​s/index.html. Can be administered by interview, paper and pencil, or computer. Items are scored based on whether they occurred, the perceived impact of the event (positive vs negative), and whether the event occurred to the respondent or a close other. Specific scoring for each item is available at the following URL: https://www.cmu.edu/dietr​ich/psych​ology/​stress-immun​ity-disea​se-lab/scale​s/pdf/lel_scori​ng_revis​ed.pdf. Higher scores indicate more exposure to life events in the past 12 months (range: 0-61). Subscales also include total negative self-events, total positive self-events, total negative other events, total positive other events, total negative events, and total positive events. The time to complete will vary based on number of items endorsed, with a mean range of 5 to 10 minutes. Minimal. When self-administered, a pencil, pen, or electronic report form are needed. Minimal training time to score; approximately 5 to 10 minutes. The LEL is in English only but can be translated. However, when generating translated versions, care should be taken to include culturally relevant events. Researchers have not evaluated floor or ceiling effects for total life events or subscales of events (eg, positive vs negative and self vs close other). This is a checklist of major life events. As such, it does not make sense to assess internal consistency because endorsement of one event is unlikely to increase the chances of endorsing another event. Test-retest reliability of this measure has not been reported. The events were a subset of those appearing in the List of Recent Experiences 48 and were chosen for their potential impact and their relatively high frequency of occurrence in population studies 49. This instrument is a checklist of exposure to major life events and not a measure of severity following exposure, which would change over time. Studies of responsiveness have not been conducted. This scale has largely been used in healthy community samples. The events included in this measure likely reflect events that happen more commonly among adults, especially among those from Western cultures. It is not intended for use in children. This scale has not been used in clinical trials. The LEL can be easily administered quickly and at low cost. It provides an assessment of both positive and negative life events that may affect the progression of rheumatic disease. This measure also goes beyond self-relevant events to obtain information on events that affect close others. This measure has not been rigorously evaluated with psychometric testing. This is particularly relevant when it comes to the stability of subjective rating of an event (eg, how one feels about a romantic breakup is likely to change over time). Moreover, some events may be more relevant to some populations than others. For example, job loss is not appropriate for a largely retired population. This measure may be useful in understanding triggers of disease; however, it has not been used in clinical or research contexts in those with rheumatologic conditions to date. Higher scores have been predictive of greater susceptibility to infectious illness in a healthy population using experimental paradigms 48, which may be relevant to patients with rheumatic conditions who are taking immunosuppressing medications because those treatments also confer an elevated risk of infection.

This article aims to: (i) outline the process of revision of Part IV of the HTQ to (a) include the new DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and (b) separate out and more fully develop the refugee-specific functioning items; and (ii) promote a consistent approach to the validation of the HTQ-5 when adapted for use in other cultures and language groups. Our process involved item mapping; expert consultations; generating items according to the new DSM-5 criteria; and drafting, refinement and finalization of the revised measure focusing closely on issues of meaning, future translation into multiple languages and comprehension amongst groups with low literacy and little or no exposure to Western trauma concepts. Validity and reliability testing of the new HTQ-5 is underway. The HTQ symptom checklist was modified consistent with current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria to identify those refugees at risk for mental health and other symptoms associated with traumatic life events, disability and dysfunction. Accurate screening of post-traumatic distress and dysfunction enables those working with refugees to triage them more effectively to scarce health and mental health resources. When developing screening measures to inform public health policy and practice, it is vital that these measures can bridge the gap between western (etic) nosologies and indigenous (emic) understandings of traumatic stress.",753

The instruments developed for the assessment of aspects related to PTSD needed a reformulation, as was the case of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL). Objectives To present the process of transcultural adaptation of the three forms of the PCL-5 to Brazilian Portuguese, as well as its face validity. Methods The procedure involved independent translations, a synthesis version, back translation by an independent translator, evaluation by the original author, analysis by an expert committee, and a pretesting study (10 subjects with/without experience of a traumatic situation). The last two steps formed the face validity procedure. Results The synthesis version was approved by the original author and the agreement percentage by the expert committee was excellent, with only two items showing < 90%. The pretesting study showed that the Brazilian version was well understood and linguistically and culturally accepted by the participants, which did not make significant suggestions for changes. Discussion Transcultural adaptation of the PCL-5 for Brazilian Portuguese followed a rigid and standardized procedure. Therefore, after having its face validity assessed by an expert committee and by the target population, it is apt to be used.",754

Trauma may lower self-esteem, which contributes to the development and maintenance of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Objectives Assessment of self-esteem in Tunisian military patients suffering from PTSD. Study of correlation between the severity of the PTSD symptoms and the rate of self-esteem. Methods Transversal descriptive study of a sample of 22 patients treated for PTSD in the Tunisian Military Hospital during the period between August and October 2016. The PTSD Cheklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were administered for patients. Results All the patients assessed were male. The mean age of the sample was 29.6 years. Fifty percent of the patients presented with a co-morbid major depression. Based on the score of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, patients had a self-esteem, which was very low in 45.45% of case, low in 45.45% of cases, average in 4.54% of cases and high in 4.54% of cases. The results also showed that lower levels of self-esteem are significantly correlated to the severity of the PTSD symptoms as measured by the PCL-5 score. Conclusions This study highlights the magnitude of self-esteem deficiency among patients suffering from PTSD. It remains unclear as to whether the relationship between trauma and depression is consistently mediated by a negative cognitive schema, such as low self-esteem, or whether trauma influences mood independently of low self-esteem. Further studies are required. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",755

After an exposure to a traumatic event, some individuals may develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Often accompanied by other psychological disorders, PTSD is a complex condition that can be associated with significant morbidity, disability, and impairment of life functions. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of intervention in enhancing the impulse control ability of PTSD patients. Present investigation included 10 PTSD adult patients (18 to 40 years). Sample included both male and female hospitalized cases from various Trauma Centres of Varanasi. To assess the intensity of traumatic symptoms among patients PTSD checklist-civilian version (PCL-C) was administered. Impulse control of the sample was measured with the help of impulse control scale. As hypothesized PTSD patients initially reported significantly low level of impulse control in terms of negative affect index 1, negative affect index 11, positive and undifferentiated index, and endurance and persistence index all of which have reportedly significantly increased (p<.01) after intervention.",756

The first-line treatment for PTSD is individualized manualized trauma-focused psychotherapy. Trauma-focused psychotherapies include a component of exposure and/or cognitive restructuring. These trauma-focused psychotherapies include Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), specific cognitive-behavioral therapies for PTSD, Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy (BEP), Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), and written narrative exposure. PTSD pharmacotherapies are second-line treatment overall. Of the pharmacotherapies, the first-line pharmacotherapies include monotherapy with sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine. All the previously mentioned treatments are discussed. The chapter briefly discusses second-line therapies in psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and complementary and alternative medicine and the current evidence available behind them. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a helpful questionnaire to monitor treatment response over time.",757

Considering that patients with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often experience disturbances in sleep, arousal, and autonomic functioning, we sought to explore the association of PNS activity during sleep with hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD. Because a broad literature supports the importance of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in PTSD, REM‐sleep features were specifically examined as predictors of PTSD symptom severity. A total of 90 participants, primarily civilian and female, aged 18–40 years who had experienced a traumatic event in the last 2 years, underwent an ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) acclimation night followed by a second PSG night from which sleep physiological measures were computed. Participants underwent an ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) acclimation night followed by a second PSG night from which sleep physiological measures were computed. PTSD severity was measured using the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition (PCL‐5). Dependent variables were total PCL‐5 score as well as its hyperarousal symptom subscore. Predictors included REM latency, percentage, density, segment length, and an index of parasympathetic tone (root mean square of the successive differences in the R–R interval or RMSSD). Hierarchical regression models were conducted to analyse the association of REM features with PCL‐5 total and hyperarousal subscales. Using hierarchical regression, REM‐sleep RMSSD accounted for a significant proportion of the variation in outcome variables, even when accounting for other REM‐sleep features. The present findings support hypothesised relationships between PTSD symptomatology and REM‐sleep physiology and, specifically, that lowered parasympathetic tone in REM may be an important associate of the hyperarousal symptom cluster in PTSD.",758

Although considerable evidence exists supporting the construct validity of CPTSD, the distinguishability of CPTSD symptoms from those of borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been questioned. The present study examined the discriminant validity of CPTSD and BPD symptoms among a trauma-exposed population sample from the United Kingdom (N = 546). Participants completed self-report measures of CPTSD and BPD symptoms, and their latent structure was assessed using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). A three-factor model with latent variables reflecting PTSD, disturbances in self-organization (DSO), and BPD symptoms provided the best fit of the data, χ2 (399, N = 546) = 1,650, p < .001; CFI = .944; TLI = .930; RMSEA = .077, 90% CI [.073, .081]. We identified multiple symptoms distinctive to individual constructs (e.g., disturbed relationships and suicidality) as well as symptoms shared across the constructs (e.g., affective dysregulation). The PTSD, β = .24; DSO, β = .23; and BPD, β = .27, latent variables were positively and significantly associated with childhood interpersonal trauma. The current findings support the discriminant validity of CPTSD and BPD symptoms and highlight various phenomenological signatures of each construct as well as demonstrate how these constructs share important similarities in symptom composition and exogenous correlates.Spanish Abstracts by Asociación Chilena de Estrés Traumático (ACET) Examinando la Validez Discriminante del Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático Complejo y de los Síntomas del Trastorno Límite de la Personalidad: Resultados de una Muestra Poblacional del Reino Unido TEPT CIE-11, TEPT COMPLEJO Y PERSONALIDAD LÍMITE El Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático Complejo (TEPT-C) se agregó a la nomenclatura diagnóstica en la 11ª revisión de la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades (CIE-11).

As research is rapidly growing and results are inconsistent, a better investigation of this subtype is of primary importance. We conducted a systematic review of studies using Latent Profile Analysis to investigate the existence of a D-PTSD subtype. Covariates of D-PTSD were included, to understand additional symptoms, risk factors and comorbidities. The search was performed on PubMed, EBSCOHost, and PTSDPubs according to 2020 PRISMA guidelines. Eligible articles assessed trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms and diagnosis, and dissociation, in adult samples. 13 of 165 articles met the inclusion criteria. All identified a dissociative subtype of PTSD, mainly characterized by higher levels of depersonalization and derealization. D-PTSD profile sometimes presented other dissociative symptoms, such as gaps in awareness and memory, other comorbid disorders, and a history of abuse. Despite some limitations, this review supports the existence of a dissociative subgroup of individuals among those with PTSD. More rigorous studies are needed to clarify these findings and their clinical implications.",760

In these patients, the stressful experience of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization may aggravate psychological conditions. Our study examines the short- and long-term psychological consequences of COVID-19 in ICU patients. COVID-19 patients completed the self-rating questionnaires Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS), Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R), and Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) and were clinically interviewed 1 and 6 months after discharge. Altered behavioral-psychological symptoms and patients' strategies (adaptive vs. maladaptive) for coping with stress during and after hospitalization were coded during clinical interviews. Between 20 and 30% of patients showed moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety and perceived stress 1 and 6 months after discharge. Sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, confusion in placing events, and fear of reinfection were observed in many (6-17%) patients. At 6 months, only 7% of patients showed PTSD symptoms, and 50% showed post-traumatic growth in the ""appreciation of life"" sub-scale. Finally, 32% of subjects were classified as ""maladaptive coping patients,"" and 68% as ""adaptive coping patients."" Patients who adopted ""adaptive"" coping strategies showed significantly lower levels of anxious-depressive symptoms and perceived stress when compared to subjects with ""maladaptive"" strategies at both time points. Coping strategy had no effect on PTSD symptoms or post-traumatic growth at 6 months. These findings clarify the short- and long-term psychological effects of intensive care due to COVID-19 infection and demonstrate that patient characteristics, particularly strategies for coping with stress, seem to play a critical role in psychological outcomes.",761

This retrospective study was conducted on combat-exposed military service members who were admitted to an inpatient residential treatment program for evaluation of fitness to serve and treatment of trauma related conditions. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to screen for PTSD, determine symptom severity, and monitor symptom change. At the time of admission, 54.3% of the service members met the provisional PTSD diagnosis, whereas at the time of discharge, 16.28% of the service members met the provisional diagnostic criteria. The most common symptoms rated moderately or higher were sleep troubles, followed by super alert, disturbing memories, feeling upset, disturbing dreams, physical reactions, avoiding memories, and negative feelings. Paired t-test results comparing the PCL-5 five Subscales and Total Score at the time of admission and discharge showed significant reductions. The five symptoms that improved the least were sleep troubles, feeling upset, avoiding memories, difficulty concentrating, and trouble remembering. The successful creation and implementation of an Armenian version of the PCL-5 was realized and, when put to the test, aided in screening, diagnosing, and monitoring PTSD symptoms among Armenian Army Service members. The results suggest that PTSD symptoms in an inpatient residential treatment program decreased over time. The symptoms that bothered the service members at most during the time of admission, however, improved the least at the time of discharge.",762

(2019) using the International Trauma Questionnaire,"Background: While empirical support for the ICD-11 distinction between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) is growing, empirical research into the ICD-11 model of CPTSD in military populations is scarce and inconsistent. Objective: To replicate a study from our own group identifying distinct classes based on CPTSD symptoms using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) and to identify predictors and functional outcomes associated with a potential distinction between PTSD and CPTSD. Method: Formerly deployed treatment-seeking Danish soldiers (N = 294) completed the ITQ and self-report measures of traumatic life events prior to treatment. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to extract classes based on CPTSD symptoms. Results: LPA revealed four classes; (1) high CPTSD symptoms ('CPTSD', 28.7%); (2) high PTSD symptoms and lower DSO symptoms ('PTSD', 23.5%); (3) high DSO symptoms ('DSO', 17.3%); and (4) low symptoms ('Low Symptoms', 30.5%). In comparison to the PTSD-class, CPTSD-class membership was not predicted by traumatic events in adult life and in childhood. The CPTSD class was more often single/divorced/widowed compared to the PTSD class. Moreover, the CPTSD class more often used psychotropic medicine compared to the DSO-class and Low Symptoms-class. Conclusion: Using the ITQ, this study yields empirical support for the ICD-11 model of CPTSD within a clinical sample of veterans. The results replicate findings from our previous study that also identified distinct profiles of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD.Antecedentes: Si bien, el soporte empírico de la clasificación de la CIE-11 para la distinción entre el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) y TEPT complejo (TEPTC) está creciendo, la investigación empírica sobre el modelo del TEPTC según la CIE-11 en poblaciones militares es escasa e inconsistente.Objetivo: Replicar un estudio de nuestro propio grupo identificando distintas clases basadas en los síntomas del TEPTC utilizando el Cuestionario Internacional de Trauma (ITQ por sus siglas en inglés) e identificar los predictores y las consecuencias funcionales asociadas a una posible distinción entre TEPT y TEPTC.Método: Los soldados daneses que estuvieron en despliegue y en búsqueda de tratamiento (N= 294) completaron el cuestionario de la ITQ y medidas de auto-reporte en relación a eventos traumáticos a lo largo de la vida antes del tratamiento. Se utilizó el análisis de perfil latente (APL) para extraer clases basadas en los síntomas del TEPTC.Resultados: El APL reveló cuatro clases; (1) síntomas elevados de TEPTC (‘TEPTC’, 28.7%); (2) síntomas elevados de TEPT y síntomas más bajos de Alteraciones en la Auto-Organización (DSO por sus siglas en inglés) (‘TEPT’, 23.5%); (3) síntomas elevados de DSO (‘DSO’, 17.3%); y (4) síntomas bajos (‘Síntomas bajos’, 30.5%). En comparación con la clase de TEPT, la afiliación a la clase del TEPTC no estuvo predicha por eventos traumáticos en la adultez y en la infancia. La clase TEPTC era más frecuentemente soltero/divorciado/viudo, en comparación con la clase TEPT. Además, la clase TEPTC utilizó con mayor frecuencia medicamentos psicotrópicos en comparación con la clase DSO y la clase de Síntomas bajos.Conclusiones: Utilizando el cuestionario ITQ, este estudio proporciona apoyo empírico para el modelo de TEPTC de la CIE-11 dentro de una muestra clínica de veteranos. Los resultados replican los hallazgos de nuestro estudio anterior, que tambien identificó distintos perfiles de TEPT y TEPTC según la clasificación de la CIE-11.背景: 尽管对ICD-11区分创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 与复杂性创伤后应激障碍 (CPTSD) 的实证支持越来越多, 对军人群体中CPTSD的ICD-11模型的实证研究很少且不一致。目的: 重复我们自己小组的一项研究, 根据使用国际创伤问卷调查 (ITQ) 测量的CPTSD症状识别不同的类别, 并确定与PTSD和CPTSD潜在区别相关的预测因素和功能结果。方法: 退伍寻求治疗的丹麦士兵 (N = 294) 在治疗之前完成了ITQ和自我报告创伤生活事件的测量。潜在剖面分析 (LPA) 用来选取基于CPTSD症状的类别。结果: LPA揭示了四个类别: (1) 高CPTSD症状类 (‘ CPTSD’, 28.7％); (2) 高PTSD症状和低DSO症状类 (‘ PTSD’, 23.5％); (3) 高DSO症状类 (‘ DSO’, 17.3％); (4) 低症状类 (‘低症状’, 30.5％) 。与PTSD类相比, 成年和童年期的创伤事件并未预测CPTSD类成员身份。与PTSD类相比, CPTSD类更常为单身/离婚/丧偶。此外, 与DSO类和低症状类相比, CPTSD类更经常使用精神药物。结论: 使用ITQ, 本研究为退伍军人临床样本中的CPTSD的ICD-11模型提供了实证支持。结果重复了我们先前研究的发现, 也确定了ICD-11 PTSD和CPTSD的不同剖面。.",764

Data were analyzed from September 2022 to August 2023.Postindex TBI(s).Demographic and clinical factors, prior TBI (ie, preindex TBI), and functional (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOSE]), postconcussive (Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire [RPQ]), psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory-18 [BSI-18]), depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 [PCL-5]), and health-related quality-of-life (Quality of Life After Brain Injury-Overall Scale [QOLIBRI-OS]) outcomes were assessed. Adjusted mean differences (aMDs) and adjusted relative risks are reported with 95% CIs.Of 2417 TRACK-TBI participants, 1572 completed the outcomes assessment at 1 year (1049 [66.7%] male; mean [SD] age, 41.6 [17.5] years) and 1084 completed the outcomes assessment at 3 to 7 years (714 [65.9%] male; mean [SD] age, 40.6 [17.0] years). At 1 year, a total of 60 participants (4%) were Asian, 255 (16%) were Black, 1213 (77%) were White, 39 (2%) were another race, and 5 (0.3%) had unknown race. At 3 to 7 years, 39 (4%) were Asian, 149 (14%) were Black, 868 (80%) were White, 26 (2%) had another race, and 2 (0.2%) had unknown race. A total of 50 (3.2%) and 132 (12.2%) reported 1 or more postindex TBIs at 1 year and 3 to 7 years, respectively. Risk factors for postindex TBI were psychiatric history, preindex TBI, and extracranial injury severity. At 1 year, compared with those without postindex TBI, participants with postindex TBI had worse functional recovery (GOSE score of 8: adjusted relative risk, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.96) and health-related quality of life (QOLIBRI-OS: aMD, -15.9; 95% CI, -22.6 to -9.1), and greater postconcussive symptoms (RPQ: aMD, 8.1; 95% CI, 4.2-11.9), psychological distress symptoms (BSI-18: aMD, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.1-8.6), depression symptoms (PHQ-9: aMD, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5-4.4), and PTSD symptoms (PCL-5: aMD, 7.8; 95% CI, 3.2-12.4). At 3 to 7 years, these associations remained statistically significant. Multiple (2 or more) postindex TBIs were associated with poorer outcomes across all domains.In this cohort study of patients with acute TBI, postindex TBI was associated with worse symptomatology across outcome domains at 1 year and 3 to 7 years postinjury, and there was a dose-dependent response with multiple postindex TBIs. These results underscore the critical need to provide TBI prevention, education, counseling, and follow-up care to at-risk patients.",765

Specifically, they significantly simplified the guidelines for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and added a new trauma disorder called complex PTSD (CPTSD). The new domains for PTSD and the addition of CPTSD require new instruments to assess these novel constructs. We developed a measure of PTSD and CPTSD (Complex Trauma Inventory; CTI) according to the proposed ICD-11 domains, creating several items to assess each domain. We examined the factor structure of the CTI (using both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses) in two separate samples of diverse college students (n1 = 501; n2 = 500), reducing the original 53 trauma items in the item pool to 21 items. Confirmatory factor analyses supported two highly-correlated second-order factors (PTSD and complex factors), with PTSD (i.e., re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-arousal) and complex factors (i.e., affect dysregulation, alterations in self-perception and alterations in relationships with others) each loading on three of the six ICD-11-consistent first-order factors (RMSEA = .08, CFI = .92, GFI = .87, SRMR = .06). Internal consistency for PTSD (α = .92) and complex factors (α = .93) are excellent.",766

These co-occurring conditions are associated with negative health consequences and disability. PTSD and harmful drinking are typically experienced as closely related thus treatments that target both simultaneously are preferred by patients. Many individuals with PTSD and harmful alcohol use receive primary care services but encounter treatment barriers in engaging in specialty mental health and substance use services. A pilot randomized controlled trial of a brief integrated treatment for PTSD and harmful drinking verses primary care- treatment as usual (PC-TAU) took place in three Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care clinics. The intervention (Primary Care Treatment Integrating Motivation and Exposure [PC-TIME]) combines Motivational Interviewing to reduce alcohol use and brief Prolonged Exposure for PTSD delivered over five brief sessions. Participants (N=63) were veterans with PTSD and harmful drinking. Multilevel growth curve modeling examined changes in drinking (average number of drinks per drinking day and percentage of heavy drinking days) and self-reported PTSD severity at baseline, 8-, 14-, and 20-weeks. Participants reported high satisfaction with PC-TIME and 70% (n=23) completed treatment. As hypothesized, a significantly steeper decrease in self-reported PTSD severity and heavy drinking was evident for participants randomized to PC-TIME compared with PC-TAU. Contrary to expectations, no significant post-treatment differences in PTSD diagnoses were observed. PC-TIME participants were less likely to exceed NIAAA guidelines for harmful alcohol use post-treatment compared with PC-TAU participants. PC-TIME is a promising brief, primary care-based treatment for individuals with co-occurring PTSD and harmful alcohol use. A full-scale randomized clinical trial is needed to fully test its effectiveness.",767

Yet until recently, such individual differences had not been considered when evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This systematic review aims to examine the emerging literature on this subject and, specifically, to identify trajectories and predictors of psychotherapeutic response in adults with PTSD. Method: Four databases were searched using specific keywords without date or language restrictions. For each study, independent reviewers systematically evaluated whether it met eligibility criteria and assessed risk of bias. For included studies, reviewers completed data extraction using standard formats. Those examining how subgroups of adults respond to therapy for clinical PTSD using trajectory modeling were deemed eligible. Demographic, PTSD, clinical, and trauma-related factors associated to particular trajectories were also examined. Results: Of the 1,727 papers identified, 11 were included in this analysis. Of these studies, six focused on military-related traumas and five on civilian ones. Although studies found between two and five trajectories, most supported a three-trajectory model of response categorized as responders, nonresponders, and subclinical participants. Over 22 predictors of treatment trajectories were examined. Comorbid depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse were the strongest predictors of poor therapeutic response. Age, combat exposure, social support, and hyperarousal were moderate predictors. Conclusion: This review provides valuable insight into the treatment of PTSD, as it supports the heterogeneous trajectories of psychotherapeutic responses and provides avenues for the development of interventions that consider individual-level factors in treatment response.",768

Concurrent measures were Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6).Results identified a bifactor model demonstrating unique posttraumatic stress, depressive, cognitive, and neurological/somatic symptom groups that were still evident after accounting for a universal factor representing general distress. These symptom groups were differentially related to concurrently measured clinical outcomes.Use of a bifactor structure may help derive clinically useful signals from self-reported symptoms among Active Duty Service Members seeking outpatient treatment for mild TBI.",769

Barriers to systematic screening could be overcome by using a tool that is both comprehensive and brief. This study aimed to determine 1) the feasibility of screening for posttraumatic sequelae among adults with minor injury in the ED and 2) the relationship between ED screening and later psychological symptoms and poor quality of life (QOL) at 6 weeks postinjury.In the EDs of two Level I trauma centers, we enrolled injured patients (n = 149) who reported serious injury and/or life threat in the past 24 hours. Subjects completed the Posttraumatic Adjustment Scale (PAS) to screen for PTSD and depression in the ED, and 6 weeks later they completed assessments for symptoms of PTSD, depression, and trauma-specific QOL (T-QoL).Our retained sample at 6 weeks was 84 adults (51.2% male; mean ± SD age = 33 ± 11.88 years); 38% screened positive for PTSD, and 76% screened positive for depression in the ED. Controlling for age, hospital admission, and ED pain score, regression analyses revealed that a positive ED screen for both PTSD and depression was significantly associated with 6 weeks PTSD (p = 0.027, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 15.14) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.001, 95% CI = 2.20 to 7.74), respectively. Further, a positive ED screen for depression (p = 0.043, 95% CI = -16.66 to -0.27) and PTSD (p = 0.015, 95% CI = -20.35 to -2.24) was significantly associated with lower T-QoL.These results suggest that it is feasible to identify patients at risk for postinjury sequelae in the ED; screening for mental health risk may identify patients in need of early intervention and further monitoring.",770

ADSM meeting study criteria for self-reported PTSD (N = 470) were grouped according to EHR-PTSD diagnostic status. Participants completed PTSD symptom assessments over a 12 month period. We used log binomial regression and linear mixed model to examine predictors of receiving an EHR-PTSD diagnosis and to analyze healthcare utilization and symptom trajectories based on diagnostic status. Thirty percent of ADSM with study-identified PTSD had an EHR-PTSD diagnosis. Combat exposure and PTSD severity predicted EHR-PTSD diagnosis. ADSM without the diagnosis were more likely to have an adjustment disorder diagnosis. Participants with an EHR-PTSD diagnosis utilized more healthcare and reported worse PTSD symptoms over 12 months. Findings suggest providers are more likely to record PTSD diagnoses for more severe, complex cases. While less severe cases may be less likely to receive a PTSD diagnosis, they may still access and benefit from care. Findings have implications for use of EHRs to describe health patterns and inform practices and policy in the Military Health System.",771

Women are disproportionately affected by PTSD than men and are more at risk in the occurrence of sexual assault victimization. Estimates suggest that 50% of women develop PTSD following sexual assault and successful clinical management can be challenging. Growing evidence has implicated neural, immune, and endocrine alterations underpinning PTSD, but only few studies have assessed the evolution of acute PTSD in women. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This study aims to measure whether the onset of PTSD is associated with accelerated aging in women following sexual assault. We hypothesize that the increase of allostatic load caused by PTSD leads to neuroprogression. We will implement a randomized clinical trial to compare responses to treatment with either interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for PTSD (IPT-PTSD) or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> We will include women between 18 and 45 years of age, who experienced sexual assault from 1 to 6 months before the initial evaluation, and present with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of PTSD. Baseline evaluation will comprise clinical and psychometric assessments, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological testing, polysomnography, evaluation of immune and endocrine parameters, and genetic analyses. Age-matched female healthy controls will be included and subjected to the same evaluation. Patients will be randomized for treatment in 1 of the 2 arms of the study for 14 weeks; follow-up will continue until 1 year after inclusion via treatment as usual. The researchers will collect clinical and laboratory data during periodic clinical assessments up to 1-year follow-up. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> Data collection started in early 2016 and will be completed by the end of the first semester of 2020. Analyses will be performed soon afterward, followed by the elaboration of several articles. Articles will be submitted in early 2021. This research project has obtained a grant from the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP 2014/12559-5). </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> We expect to provide insight into the consequences of recent sexual assault exposure in women by investigating the degree of neuroprogression developing from an early stage of PTSD. We also expect to provide important evidence on the efficacy of a non-exposure psychotherapy (IPT-PTSD) to mitigate PTSD symptoms in recently sexually assaulted women.

Although, most individuals demonstrate resilience, a significant subset of the population develops significant long-term distress (La Greca et al. 2013; Lai, et al., 2015; Lowe & Rhodes 2013; Self-Brown et al., 2014). Moreover, results from emerging longitudinal research suggests that symptom patterns are heterogenous. For example, some individuals recover over time or demonstrate a delayed onset. The most commonly studied post-disaster reaction in adults is posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, the extant literature examining elevated PTS symptoms and related risk factors in disaster research has relied largely on cross-sectional post-hoc designs, with few studies examining PTS symptom trajectories from a longitudinal perspective. The current study sought to build upon post-disaster recovery theory, by examining PTS trajectories in a diverse sample of primarily low-income mothers impacted by Hurricane Katrina, as well as identifying predictor variables (i.e., prior trauma, hurricane exposure, coping behavior, social support, and family functioning) associated with specific symptom trajectories. Data was collected over two years following the Hurricane Katrina (2005-2007). Utilizing Latent Class Growth Analysis, results revealed that a three-trajectory model (i.e., recovering, chronic, and resilient) best fit the data. Significant risk and protective factors differentiating trajectory membership included prior trauma, hurricane-related loss and disruption, social support, and children’s internalizing symptoms. Implications of study findings and directions for future research are discussed.",773

Of 194 patients, 88 were eligible for randomization. <h3>Interventions</h3> Participants received D-CPT or WL/TA. Cognitive processing therapy was enhanced by a motivational and alliance-building phase, by including emotion regulation and consideration of typical developmental tasks, and by higher session frequency in the trauma-focused core CPT phase. In WL/TA, participants received treatment advice with respective recommendations of clinicians and were offered D-CPT after 7 months. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> All outcomes were assessed before treatment (baseline), approximately 8 weeks after the start of treatment, after the end of treatment (posttreatment), and at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed in clinical interview (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents for<i>DSM-IV</i>[CAPS-CA]). Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD severity, depression, borderline symptoms, behavior problems, and dissociation. <h3>Results</h3> The 88 participants (75 [85%] female) had a mean age of 18.1 years (95% CI, 17.6-18.6 years). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 44 participants receiving D-CPT (39 [89%] female) demonstrated greater improvement than the 44 WL/TA participants (36 [82%] female) in terms of PTSD severity (mean CAPS-CA scores, 24.7 [95% CI, 16.6-32.7] vs 47.5 [95% CI, 37.9-57.1]; Hedges<i>g</i> = 0.90). This difference was maintained through the follow-up (mean CAPS-CA scores, 25.9 [95% CI, 16.2-35.6] vs 47.3 [95% CI, 37.8-56.8]; Hedges<i>g</i> = 0.80). Treatment success was greatest during the trauma-focused core phase. The D-CPT participants also showed greater and stable improvement in all secondary outcomes, with between-groups effect sizes ranging from 0.65 to 1.08 at the posttreatment assessment (eg, for borderline symptoms, 14.1 [95% CI, 8.0-20.2] vs 32.0 [95% CI, 23.8-40.2]; Hedges<i>g</i>= 0.91). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Adolescents and young adults with abuse-related PTSD benefited more from D-CPT than from WL/TA. Treatment success was stable at the follow-up and generalized to borderline symptoms and other comorbidities. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> German Clinical Trials Register identifier:DRKS00004787",774
https://openalex.org/W3216441300,,"An Evaluation of the Structure, Comorbidity, and Correlates of Posttraumatic Stress Responses in Older Adults Across Multiple National Samples","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) are often chronic and debilitating conditions that can cause significant impairment in an individual’s personal, professional, and social life. However, research pertaining to posttraumatic stress responses among older adults is lacking. The present thesis aimed to address this gap in the literature by evaluating the structure, psychiatric comorbidity, and correlates of posttraumatic stress responses among older adults. The most contemporary models of PTSD (as outlined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-5] and the eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases [ICD-11]) provided a valid representation of PTSD among older adults. Four DSM-5 symptoms demonstrated sex item-bias, with females being more likely to endorse three symptoms (B1: 'unwanted memories', B4: 'feeling upset', and E6: 'sleep problems') and males being more likely to endorse one symptom (E2: ‘reckless or self-destructive behaviour’). Alternatively, there was no evidence of item-bias for the six ICD-11 symptoms. Regarding comorbidity, a dimensional framework of psychopathology was successful in accounting for the psychiatric comorbidities of PTSD. More specifically, evidence supported the existence of two distinct subtypes of ICD-11 PTSD psychiatric comorbidity classes among older adults, with the higher comorbidity class being associated with a history of attempted suicide. In terms of PTSD/CPTSD correlates, evidence of longitudinal relationships between subtypes of loneliness (social and emotional) and PTSD, and cross-sectional relationships between loneliness and CPTSD symptoms were found in older adults. These results have important implications for both research and clinical practice regarding the assessment and treatment of PTSD and CPTSD in later life. These findings imply that the current diagnostic models of PTSD are applicable in older adults; identify the psychiatric 
disorders that are likely to manifest alongside PTSD in later life; and highlight loneliness as a clinically meaningful construct among trauma-exposed older adults.",775

https://openalex.org/W4386009533,10.1002/jclp.23581,Assessing posttraumatic stress disorder symptom clusters with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory‐3 in a forensic disability sample,"Abstract Objective Previous evidence indicates that scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) family of instruments can measure self‐reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology and differentiate symptom clusters, including in forensic disability assessments. However, limited research has examined assessment of PTSD symptoms with the MMPI‐3, the most recent MMPI instrument. The goal of the current study was to identify the strongest MMPI‐3 scale predictors of individual PTSD symptom clusters, measured via self‐report. Methods Using a sample of 716 disability claimants (54.2% men; M age = 42.98, SD = 10.87; 81.8% White), correlation, regression, and dominance analyses were performed to examine associations between scores on MMPI‐3 scales and latent PTSD symptom cluster factors derived using confirmatory factor analyses from items of the Detailed Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress (DAPS), and to identify the strongest predictor of each symptom cluster when MMPI‐3 scales were concurrently considered. Results Results indicate that conceptually expected MMPI‐3 scale scores were meaningfully associated with PTSD symptom cluster factors, with the MMPI‐3 Anxiety‐Related Experiences (ARX) scale demonstrating the strongest and most consistent associations across symptom clusters. Conclusions Results of the current study largely converge with previous empirical studies of self‐reported PTSD symptoms in disability claimant settings with the MMPI instruments. Interpretive implications for the MMPI‐3, limitations, and future research directions are discussed.",777
https://openalex.org/W2473972433,10.1037/tra0000104,Support for the 7-factor hybrid model of PTSD in a community sample.,"Research suggests that 4-factor models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be improved upon by the addition of novel factors, such as Dysphoric Arousal, Externalizing Behaviors, and Anhedonia. However, a novel 7-factor hybrid model has demonstrated superior fit in veteran and undergraduate samples. The current study sought to replicate this finding in a trauma-exposed community sample and examined relations with positive (PA) and negative affect (NA).Participants included 403 adults (M(age) = 37.75) recruited through Amazon's MTurk. PTSD was measured using the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5). Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in Mplus.The 7-factor hybrid model demonstrated good fit: CFI = .96, TLI = .95, RMSEA = .06 (90% CI [.05, .07]), SRMR = .03. This model was superior to the 5- and 6-factor models. All factors demonstrated significant relations with PA and NA, the largest of which were the Externalizing Behaviors (with NA) and Anhedonia (with PA) factors.Results provide support for the 7-factor hybrid model of PTSD using the PCL-5 in a community sample. Findings replicate previous research suggesting that PTSD is highly related to NA, which has been purported as an underlying dimension of PTSD. It is recommended that future research use clinical measures to further examine the hybrid model. (PsycINFO Database Record",778

Methods A total of 119 patients with PTSD were randomly assigned to a physical activity condition (PA; n = 59) or a non-physical activity control condition (nPA; n = 60). The 8-day intensive TFT programme consisted of daily prolonged exposure, EMDR therapy, and psychoeducation, which was complemented with physical activities versus controlled mixtures of guided (creative) tasks. As a primary outcome, the change in clinician and self-reported PTSD symptoms from pre-to post-treatment and at 6 months follow-up were measured. Results Intent-to-treat linear mixed-effects models showed no significant differences between the PA and nPA conditions on change in PTSD severity. Clinician and self-reported PTSD symptoms significantly decreased for both conditions, with large effect sizes (e.g., CAPS-5 d pre-post = 2.28). At post-treatment, 80.0% in the PA, and 82.7% in the nPA condition no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Regarding the loss of Complex PTSD diagnoses this was 92.5% and 95.0%, respectively. Conclusion Either with additional physical or non-physical activities, intensive TFT is very effective for the treatment of (Complex) PTSD, as reflected by large effect sizes and loss of diagnostic status in both groups.

Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted at participants' one-year follow-up after a recently completed phase 2 clinical trial. Available interviews from 19 of 24 participants were analyzed. This qualitative analysis sought to complement, clarify, and expand upon the quantitative findings obtained from the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) and supported by the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Questionnaire. Pertinent data from interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) methodological framework. We explore prominent thematic elements from participant accounts to better understand the outcomes experienced in this trial. All participants reported experiencing lasting personal benefits and enhanced quality of life that extend beyond quantifiable symptom reduction. We explore a range of treatment benefits beyond symptom reduction to highlight the utility of qualitative investigations of the process and effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Limitations and challenges encountered in conducting this study are discussed along with recommendations for improved qualitative research protocols in future clinical trials.",780

It is supported by nearly 25 years of anecdotal and clinical reports. This study reports the first scientific evaluation of the protocol. Methods: A 30-person pilot study using male Veterans with a pre-existing diagnosis of PTSD. Intake criteria included interviews and confirmatory re-diagnosis using the PTSD Checklist–Military version (PCL-M). Of 33 people who met the inclusion criteria, 26 completed treatment using the RTM protocol. A small ( n = 5) wait-list control group was included. All participants were reassessed following treatment using the PCL-M. Results: Of 26 program completers, 25 (96%) were symptom free at 6-week follow-up. Mean PCL-M score at intake was 61 points. At the 6-week follow-up, the mean PCL-M score was 28.8, with a mean reduction in scores of 33 points. Hedges’ g was computed for 6-week follow-up and showed a 2.9 SD difference from intake to follow-up. A wait-list control analysis indicated non-significant symptom changes during the 2-week wait period.

The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate the presence of cancer-related traumatic dissociative symptomatology in a sample of cancer patients; (2) examine the correlation of cancer-related dissociation and sociodemographic and medical variables, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptomatology; (3) investigate the predictors of cancer-related dissociation.Ninety-two mixed cancer patients (mean age: 58.94, ds = 10.13) recruited from two hospitals in northern Italy were administered a questionnaire on sociodemographic and medical characteristics, the Karnofsky Scale to measure the level of patient activity and medical care requirements, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate the presence of anxiety and depression, the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) to assess the severity of intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigilance, and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ) to quantify the traumatic dissociative symptomatology.31.5% of participants report a PDEQ score above the cutoff. The results indicated that dissociative symptomatology was positively correlated with HADS scores (HADS-Anxiety: r = 0.476, p < 0.001; HADS-Depression: r = 0.364, p < 0.001) and with IES-R scores (IES-R-Intrusion: r = 0.698, p < 0.001; IES-R-Avoidance: r = 0.619, p < 0.001; IES-R- Hypervigilance: r = 0.681, p < 0.001). A stepwise regression analysis was performed in order to find the predictors of cancer-related traumatic dissociative symptomatology. The results converged on a three predictor model revealing that IES-R-Intrusion, IES-R-Avoidance, and IES-R-Hyperarousal accounted for 53.9% of the explained variance.These findings allow us to hypothesize a specific psychological reaction which may be ascribed to the traumatic spectrum within the context of cancer, emphasizing the close relationship between the origin of dissociative constituents which, according to the scientific literature, compose the traumatic experience. Our results have implications for understanding dissociative symptomatology in a cancer population and can help develop clinical programs of prevention and support for patients.",782

In total, 2686 veterans treated for PTSD between 2002 and 2015 across 14 hospitals in Australia completed the PTSD Checklist at intake, discharge, and 3 and 9 months follow-up. Predictor variables included co-morbid mental health problems, relationship functioning, employment and compensation status.Five distinct classes were found: those with the most severe PTSD at intake separated into a relatively large class (32.5%) with small change, and a small class (3%) with a large change. Those with slightly less severe PTSD separated into one class comprising 49.9% of the total sample with large change effects, and a second class comprising 7.9% with extremely large treatment effects. The final class (6.7%) with least severe PTSD at intake also showed a large treatment effect. Of the multiple predictor variables, depression and guilt were the only two found to predict differences in response trajectories.These findings highlight the importance of assessing guilt and depression prior to treatment for PTSD, and for severe cases with co-morbid guilt and depression, considering an approach to trauma-focused therapy that specifically targets guilt and depression-related cognitions.",783

Sleep problems also may exacerbate PTSD symptom severity. Understanding how PTSD and sleep may reinforce one another is critical for informing effective treatments.In a sample of 452 World Trade Center 9/11 responders (mean age = 55.22, 89.4% male, 66.1% current or former police), we examined concurrent and cross-lagged associations between PTSD symptom severity, insomnia symptoms, nightmares, and sleep quality at 3 time points ∼1 year apart. Data were analyzed using random intercept cross-lagged panel models.PTSD symptom severity and sleep variables were relatively stable across time (intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.63 to 0.84). Individuals with more insomnia symptoms, more nightmares, and poorer sleep quality had greater PTSD symptom severity, on average. Within-person results revealed that greater insomnia symptoms and nightmares at Time 1 were concurrently associated with greater PTSD symptoms at Time 1. Insomnia symptoms were also concurrently associated with PTSD symptoms at Times 2 and 3, respectively. Cross-lagged and autoregressive results revealed that PTSD symptoms and nightmares predicted nightmares at the next timepoint.Overall, results suggest PTSD and sleep problems may be linked at the same point in time but may not always influence each other longitudinally. Further, individuals who experience more sleep disturbances on average may suffer from more debilitating PTSD. Evidence-based treatments for PTSD may consider incorporating treatment of underlying sleep disturbances and nightmares.",784
https://openalex.org/W1969029404,10.1016/j.brat.2015.03.003,Imagery vividness ratings during exposure treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder as a predictor of treatment outcome,"Within exposure-based trauma treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), imagery vividness during imaginal exposure of the traumatic memory is an understudied but potentially important predictor of treatment outcome. Further, to our knowledge, this relationship has only been studied in women to date, and never among individuals with PTSD and substance use disorders which could impact ability to produce vivid mental imagery and its impact. The current study investigated whether imagery vividness ratings during in-session exposure predicted post-treatment PTSD symptom severity in a sample of men and women with comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders, and also examined whether gender moderated this relationship. A sample of 71 participants who received an exposure-based trauma treatment were included in the analyses. PTSD symptom severity was assessed using both the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results varied according to method of assessing PTSD symptom severity. Higher imagery vividness was associated with better treatment outcome when assessed by the CAPS, with vividness in later sessions relating more strongly to outcome than vividness in earlier sessions. With the IES-R, higher imagery vividness ratings predicted more favorable treatment outcome for men, but less favorable treatment outcomes for women. Findings are discussed in the context of using imagery vividness to maximize treatment outcomes and future research directions involving scientific replication.",785

Intensive treatment may lead to faster symptom reduction, which may contribute to treatment motivation and thereby to reduction of dropout. Objective: The aim of the current study was to investigate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an intensive five-day inpatient treatment with Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and trauma-informed yoga for patients with PTSD. Method: A non-controlled pilot study with 12 adult patients with PTSD was conducted. At baseline the PTSD diagnosis was assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) and comorbid disorders with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Primary outcome was self-reported PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Check List for DSM-5; PCL-5) measured at the beginning of day 1 (T1), at the end of day 5 (T2) and at follow-up on day 21 (T3). Reliable change indexes (RCI) and clinically significant changes were calculated. Results: From T1 to T3, PTSD symptoms significantly improved with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.91). Nine of the 11 patients who completed treatment showed reliable changes in terms of self-reported PTSD. At T3, two of the patients no longer met criteria for PTSD as measured with the PCL-5. One patient dropped out after the first day. No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions: The majority of patients in our pilot study experienced symptom reduction consistent with reliable changes in this five-day inpatient treatment with EMDR and yoga. Randomized controlled trials - with longer follow up periods - are needed to properly determine efficacy and efficiency of intensive clinical treatments for PTSD compared to regular treatment. This is one of the first studies to show that intensive EMDR treatment is feasible and is indicative of reliable improvement in PTSD symptoms in a very short time frame.Planteamiento: Se ha demostrado que las psicoterapias centradas en el trauma para el TEPT son eficaces, pero también tienen tasas considerables de falta de respuesta y abandono. El tratamiento intensivo puede llevar a una reducción más rápida de los síntomas, lo que puede contribuir a la motivación para el tratamiento y, por lo tanto, a la reducción del abandono. Objetivo: El objetivo del presente estudio fue investigar la viabilidad y eficacia preliminar de un tratamiento intensivo de 5 días para pacientes hospitalizados con Desensibilización y Reprocesamiento por Movimientos Oculares (EMDR) y yoga basado en el trauma para pacientes con TEPT. Método: Se realizó un estudio piloto no controlado con 12 pacientes adultos con TEPT. Al inicio del estudio, se evaluó el diagnóstico de TEPT con el CAPS-5 y los trastornos comórbidos con el MINI. El resultado principal fue la gravedad de los síntomas de PTSD por medio de autoinforme (PCL-5) medida al comienzo del día 1 (T1), al final del día 5 (T2) y en el seguimiento el día 21 (T3). Se calcularon los índices de cambio fiable (RCI, por sus siglas en inglés) y los cambios clínicamente significativos. Resultados: De T1 a T3, los síntomas de TEPT mejoraron significativamente con un tamaño de efecto grande (d de Cohen = 0,91) y 9 de los 11 pacientes que completaron el tratamiento mostraron cambios fiables en términos de auto-informes de TEPT. En T3, dos de los pacientes ya no cumplían los criterios para el trastorno de estrés postraumático medido con el PCL-5. Un paciente se retiró después del primer día. No se produjeron eventos adversos graves. Conclusiones: la mayoría de los pacientes en nuestro estudio piloto experimentaron una reducción de síntomas consistente con cambios fiables en este tratamiento de 5 días con EMDR y yoga. Se necesitan ensayos controlados aleatorios, con períodos de seguimiento más largos, para determinar adecuadamente la eficacia y la eficiencia de los tratamientos clínicos intensivos para el TEPT en comparación con el tratamiento habitual. Este es uno de los primeros estudios que demuestra que el tratamiento intensivo con EMDR es factible y es indicativo de una mejora fiable en los síntomas de TEPT después de un período de tiempo muy corto.背景：创伤中心的 PTSD心理治疗已被证实有效，但同时也有不容忽视的无效者和脱落率。 目标：本研究的目的是考察用于治疗PTSD 的一个为期5天的住院病人强化治疗的可行性和早期有效性，治疗中使用眼动脱敏和再强化（EMDR）和创伤瑜伽。 方法：在无控制组实验中使用12名成年PTSD病人。在基线期，使用 CAPS-5进行PTSD 诊断，使用 MINI 进行工病诊断。主要结果使用自评的 PTSD 症状严重度（PCL-5），在第一天开始（T1），第5天结束（T2）和第21天的追踪期（T3）。计算可靠改变指数（RCI）和临床显著改变。 结果：从 T1到T3的 PTSD 症状显著改善，效应值较大(Cohen’s d = 0.91) 。11个完整完成治疗的病人中的9个显示了自评PTSD的可靠改变。在 T3，两个病人不再符合 PCL-5的PTSD 诊断标准。一个病人在第一天之后脱落。没有出现严重的负面事件。 结论：大部分的病人在我们的试验研究中体验了症状减轻，并在使用 EMDR和瑜伽的5天住院病人治疗中得到保持。还需要（更长追踪期的）随机对照试验将这个 PTSD强化临床治疗和普通治疗进行对比，对其效果和效率进行适当的验证。这是展示强化 EMDR 治疗可行性的比较早的研究，在比较短的时间框架下显示了 PTSD 症状可靠的改善。.",786
https://openalex.org/W3199047321,10.1037/tra0001139,Types of trauma-related blame following interpersonal trauma.,"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) now includes trauma-related blame as a symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD Criterion D3; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). To date, most blame research has utilized quantitative scales, primarily for self-blame, with little attention to other forms of blame. The aims of this study were to (a) identify the common blame types reported by interpersonal trauma survivors through open-ended statements, and (b) explore how well these blame types converge with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) screener's blame item and total scores.Using a mixed-method design, interpersonal trauma survivors (N = 132) completed the Life Events Checklist and the PCL-5. They also provided a written statement indicating why they believe their traumatic event occurred, which was later coded into types of blame by three independent raters.Five blame types emerged from survivors' statements: self, perpetrator, other, global, and circumstance. However, in most cases the presence or absence of each of the blame types was not reliably associated with posttraumatic distress.The findings suggest that trauma-related blame attributions are more nuanced than is typically measured and that factors such as the degree of distress caused by a particular blame attribution, or how believable the thought is to the survivor, might be more clinically meaningful than the specific content of the belief. Clinicians and researchers might benefit from the development of a more nuanced measure of trauma-related blame. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",787

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: This is an analytic, cross sectional design. Adults receiving health services will participate in the study. Recruited participants will provide informed consent during a visit to a community mental health clinic or community hospital. They will complete a demographic document and four retrospective questionnaires about the variables of study. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We expect that a high rate of potentially traumatic events (PTEs) is associated with an increased rate of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). We also expect that a high rate of PTSS is associated with an increased rate of posttraumatic growth (PTG). We expect that a high rate of resilience is associated with low rates of PTSS and PTG. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: This is a first step in the development of effective, clearly targeted interventions, specifically designed to treat negative effects, and also to facilitate positive change and resilience after PTE exposure.",788

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between criminal proceedings and the psychiatric symptoms in Korean PTSD patients. Methods: From March 2019 to November 2020, 63 PTSD patients at University Hospital were enrolled in this study. Among them, 11 patients were involved in the process of criminal proceedings. All patients were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), PTSD checklist-5 (PCL- 5), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Korea Version of Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-K) and, the P4 Suicidality Screener (P4). Results: PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and hazardous drinking were higher in the group of criminal proceedings. There was no significant difference in suicidal idea between the two groups. Involving criminal proceedings of PTSD patients was significantly related to hazardous drinking, and the results were significant even after controlling the severity of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion : The criminal proceedings were associated with the worsening of clinical symptoms in PTSD patients and had an independent effect on hazardous drinking. Our results suggest that interventions and social support for effective coping strategies for the trauma survivor involved in criminal proceedings are needed.",789

The present study sought to examine 1) the structural validity of ICD-11 C-PTSD, 2) the association between latent C-PTSD factors and features of dissociation, and 3) whether patients with C-PTSD show elevated levels of dissociation when compared to PTSD and no ICD-11 PTSD disorder. A sample of traumatized psychiatric outpatients ( N = 114) were diagnosed with a structured interview and subsequently administered the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), the Dissociative Symptom Scale (DSS), and the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire, 5-items (SDQ). We used Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to replicate the established structure of C-PTSD as operationalized with the ITQ. Subsequently, a structural equation model (SEM) approach was employed to examine associations of ITQ with psychoform and somatoform dissociation as measured with the DSS and SDQ. The expected factorial structure of C-PTSD was replicated in the present sample, and the domains PTSD and disturbances in self-organization were found to be related but distinct constructs. All ICD-11 C-PTSD latent factors were associated with dissociative experiences. The strongest effects were found for the symptom clusters Affective Dysregulation, Disturbances in Relationship, and Re -Experiencing. However, dissociative Gaps in Awareness and Memory and Sensory Misperception were not predicted by any ICD-11 C-PTSD latent factors. Cumulative levels of dissociative experiences appeared to differentiate ICD-11 PTSD and C-PTSD with significantly higher levels for C-PTSD. ICD-11 C-PTSD is strongly associated with dissociative phenomena in complex ways. Somatoform and psychoform manifestations of dissociation should be routinely assessed in patients with ICD-11 C-PTSD because such expressions may cover intense affects and painful relationship experiences. Future studies are needed to substantiate the causal and predictive relationship between ICD-11 C-PTSD and dissociation.",790

The specific stress version of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL), a 17- item self-report instrument corresponding to DSM–IV criteria for PTSD was utilized. To classify the neurological status of TSCI individuals, American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) and International Standard for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) were used. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis between independent variables and normalized PCL score was done to evaluate the predictors of PTSD.Results: Among 163 patients, the overall prevalence of PTSD was 27%, and the mean PCL score was 36±13.9. Factors predictive of PTSD included gender, family type, ethnicity, and literacy rate. No significant association was found between the clinical characteristics and PTSD.Conclusions: PTSD appears to be considerably prevalent among individuals with TSCI in Nepal. Females, individuals from nuclear families, individuals with lower literacy, and individuals from lower caste are significantly vulnerable to developing PTSD.

https://openalex.org/W4288439571,10.3791/63803,A Protocol for the Induction of Posttraumatic Stress-Disorder (PTSD)-like Behavior in Mice,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition that precipitates in ~10% of individuals exposed to a traumatic event (TE). Symptoms include recurrent and intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, and reckless or destructive behavior. Given the complex and heterogeneous nature of the disease, animal models for PTSD-like symptomatology are of increasing interest to the field of PTSD research. Because resilience to PTSD-like symptomatology is an important epidemiologic aspect of PTSD, animal models that resolve vulnerable and resilient animals are of particular value. Due to the complex nature of the PTSD phenotype and the potential overlaps between PTSD-like behavior and behaviors associated with other stress-induced psychopathologies such as anxiety or depression, animal models that utilize multiple readouts for PTSD-like behavior are also of increasing value. We utilize a paradigm developed by Lebow et al. 2012 for the induction and identification of PTSD-like symptomatology in mice. This paradigm utilizes inescapable electric foot shock, administered in two decontextualized sessions over two consecutive days. Stressed mice perform four behavioral tests - dark/light transfer, marble burying, acoustic startle, and home cage activity - to generate five behavioral readouts of PTSD-like behavior: % risk assessment (%RA), % marbles buried (%MB), % prepulse inhibition (%PPI), latency to peak startle amplitude (LPSA), and % light phase activity (%LPA). PTSD-like symptomatology is characterized by decreased %RA, increased %MB, decreased %PPI, decreased LPSA, and increased %LPA. The 20% of animals displaying the most PTSD-like behavior in each test are awarded a certain number of points depending on the test, and animals scoring sufficient points are designated as PTSD-like, while animals scoring no points are designated PTSD-resilient. This paradigm identifies PTSD-like behavior in ~15% of animals, a rate comparable to that observed in humans. This protocol represents a robust and reproducible paradigm for the induction of PTSD-like behavior in mice.",792

This preliminary study tested the reliability of the DES, especially temporal stability and validity, in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia receiving inpatient or outpatient treatment. The DES was administered at a university-affiliated training hospital in South Korea to a total of 68 patients (39 inpatients and 29 outpatients) whose diagnosis of schizophrenia was confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis Disorders. Internal consistency, 4-week test-retest reliability, and validity were calculated. Participants also completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Symptom Checklist-Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale. Four-week test-retest reliability was moderate (r = .69) and internal consistency was good (Cronbach's α = .95). Total score on the DES was correlated with childhood trauma (r = .69, p < .001), posttraumatic symptoms (r = .50, p < .001), and depression (r = .52, p < .001), demonstrating the convergent validity of the scale. Our study confirms the psychometric soundness of the DES among patients with schizophrenia after the acute stage of illness (e.g., 3 weeks after admission), supporting use of the scale for screening and evaluating dissociative symptoms within this population.",793

Undergraduate students (n = 838 English, n = 262 French) completed the PCL-5 as well as other self-report symptom measures of PTSD and depression online. Both the English and French versions PCL-5 total scores demonstrated excellent internal consistency (English: α = .95; French: α = .94), and strong convergent and divergent validity. Strong internal consistency was also observed for each of the four subscales for each version (α’s > .79). Test-retest reliability for the French version of the measure was also very good (r = .89). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the four-factor DSM-5 model was not a good fit of the data. The seven-factor hybrid model best fit the data in each sample, but was only marginally superior to the six-factor anhedonia model. The French version of the PCL-5 demonstrated the same psychometric qualities as both the English version of the same measure and previous versions of the PCL. Thus clinicians serving French-speaking clients now have access to this highly used screening instrument. With regards to the structural validity of the PCL-5 and of the new PTSD diagnostic structure of the DSM-5, additional research is warranted.

In total, one-hundred forty-seven inpatients of one-hundred seventy-four inpatients (85% of the initial sample) underwent all the assessments. Injured inpatients admitted to the No. 1 People's Hospital of Zhaotong City after a severe earthquake (6.5 on the Richter scale) were enrolled in the study and assessed using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale, and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Scale.At the first, third and eighteenth months after the earthquake, the prevalence rates for PTSD were 23, 14, and 7%, respectively. In a regression model, bereavement, history of major diseases, and severe injury in the earthquake were associated with severe PTSD symptoms. HRQoL was negatively correlated with PTSD symptoms. Compared to that of Chinese norms, participants' HRQoL was significantly lower in all eight HRQoL domains of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Scale.The findings suggest that a substantial proportion of inpatients injured in the earthquake experienced severe PTSD symptoms and poor HRQoL. Therefore, early preventive programs and interventions should be implemented following disasters, to reduce PTSD and improve HRQoL in injured individuals.",795

We defined d-PTSD as the presence of either depersonalization or derealization according to additional dissociative items of the CAPS. About one third (n = 82, 32.9%) of patients were designated as having d-PTSD.Results: Compared to the other patients with PTSD, those with d-PTSD were younger, had more severe PTSD symptoms, frequent interpersonal trauma, and a higher number of comorbid disorders. When these variables and their interactions were entered into a logistic regression model, younger age, severe PTSD symptoms and two or more comorbid conditions remained for the final model. We did not find a significant difference in improvement over the course of treatment between two groups.Conclusions: This study highlights the high prevalence of d-PTSD in a clinical population. Associated features of d-PTSD were similar to those reported in the Euro-American literature. Further studies are needed to better understand mechanisms and treatment options for d-PTSD.",796

However, few studies have utilized a large multisite dataset to understand this complex relationship. Our study assessed the relationship between alcohol and cannabis use trajectories and PTSD and depression symptoms across 3 months in recently trauma-exposed civilians.In total, 1618 (1037 female) participants provided self-report data on past 30-day alcohol and cannabis use and PTSD and depression symptoms during their emergency department (baseline) visit. We reassessed participant's substance use and clinical symptoms 2, 8, and 12 weeks posttrauma. Latent class mixture modeling determined alcohol and cannabis use trajectories in the sample. Changes in PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed across alcohol and cannabis use trajectories via a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance.Three trajectory classes (low, high, increasing use) provided the best model fit for alcohol and cannabis use. The low alcohol use class exhibited lower PTSD symptoms at baseline than the high use class; the low cannabis use class exhibited lower PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline than the high and increasing use classes; these symptoms greatly increased at week 8 and declined at week 12. Participants who already use alcohol and cannabis exhibited greater PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline that increased at week 8 with a decrease in symptoms at week 12.Our findings suggest that alcohol and cannabis use trajectories are associated with the intensity of posttrauma psychopathology. These findings could potentially inform the timing of therapeutic strategies.",797

The purpose of this study is to report real-world outcomes in a series of patients treated with the intervention in clinical practice.This paper reports pre- and post-treatment self-reported symptom reduction, measures of respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, drop-out and adherence rates drawn from an automatic data repository in a large real-world series of patients receiving CGRI for panic disorder and PTSD.Patients used the intervention in their homes, supported by telehealth coaching.Patients meeting symptom criteria for panic disorder (n = 1,395) or posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 174) were treated following assessment by a healthcare professional.Capnometry Guided Respiratory Intervention is a 28-day home-based treatment that provides breath-to-breath feedback of respiratory rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, aimed at normalizing respiratory style and increasing patients' mastery for coping with symptoms of stress, anxiety, and panic. Health coaches provide initial training with weekly follow up during the treatment episode. Remote data upload and monitoring facilitates individualized coaching and aggregate outcomes analysis.Self-reported Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) scores were obtained at pre-treatment and post-treatment.Panic disorder (PD) patients showed a mean pre-to-post-treatment reduction in total PDSS scores of 50.2% (P < 0.001, d = 1.31). Treatment response rates for PD (defined as a 40% or greater reduction in PDSS total scores) were observed in 65.3% of the PD patients. PTSD patients showed a pre-to-post-treatment reduction in total PCL-5 scores of 41.1% (P < 0.001, d = 1.16). The treatment response rate for PTSD (defined as a ≥10-point reduction in PCL-5 scores) was 72.4%. In an additional analysis of response at the individual level, 55.7% of panic disorder patients and 53.5% of PTSD patients were classified as treatment responders using the Reliable Change Index. Patients with both normal and below-normal baseline exhaled CO2 levels experienced comparable benefit. Across the 28-day treatment period, mean adherence rates of 74.8% (PD) and 74.9% (PTSD) were recorded during the 28-day treatment. Dropout rates were 10% (PD) and 11% (PTSD) respectively.The results from this cohort of 1,569 patients treated with the CGRI intervention demonstrate significant rates of symptom reduction and adherence consistent with prior published clinical trials. The brief duration of treatment, high adherence rates, and clinical benefit suggests that CGRI provides an important addition to treatment options for panic disorder and PTSD.",798

Subjective perception is considered a key element in the prediction of resistant or vulnerable responses to trauma and crisis. This study aimed to assess the relationship between perceived physical life threat (PT) and perceived life impact (PI) with post-traumatic symptomatology (PTSD), in a sample of 3.565 persons from 12 countries across nine different traumatic events. Methods . Participants were classified into four groups of self-perceived resistance based on their levels of PT and PI. Results . Main results show Non-affected was the most frequent category in natural catastrophes (48.9%), migration (45.9%), motor vehicle accidents (39.83%), and death threats (33.4%). In the case of sexual abuse by a relative or close person (44.5%), sexual abuse by a stranger (33.9%), and having a severe, chronic, or disabling illness (47.3%), the most frequent category was Survivor . For domestic violence, the most frequent category was Vulnerable (45.5%). Resistant was never the most frequent category for any of the events studied. Although gender and lower education predicted PTSD in most events of trauma and crisis, they were a weak predictor of vulnerable versus resistance categories. Conclusion These results suggest that the Perceived Resistance Indicator can provide insights into the narratives of resistance or vulnerability associated with extreme experiences.",799

This study explored (1) the prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression symptoms, and disordered sleep among young, violently injured, emergency department patients; and (2) how PTSD and depression symptoms are associated with sleep quality. Clinical scales for PTSD (PCL-5), depression (PHQ-8), and sleep (PROMIS®) were completed by 88 survivors of violent assault (gunshot, stabbing or assault) one month or less after presenting to an urban emergency department. High proportions of participants met criteria for prospective PTSD (59.1%), major depression (44.3%) or disordered sleep (34.1%), with 27.3% meeting criteria for all three conditions. Poorer sleep quality was correlated with higher levels of depression symptoms and PTSD symptoms. Survivors of violence experience symptoms that may further impair their sleep and behavioral health. Emergency providers should ask survivors about sleep/trauma symptoms and consider referral to trauma-informed behavioral health care.",800

Aim of this evaluation is to estimate the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth in postpartum women and to evaluate the influence of maternal, obstetrical and neonatal characteristics on the degree of PTSD symptoms measured by the Impact of Events Scale questionnaire (IES-R). Methods In total, 589 women who gave birth in the University Medical Center Mainz, Germany in 2016, participated in a survey within the first days after birth. Of these, 278 also participated 6 months later. All participants received the validated Impact of Events Scale questionnaire (IES-R). The influence of maternal, obstetric and fetal parameters on PTSD score was evaluated. Results PTSD overall prevalence was 2.9%. Patients with PTSD had significantly less often personal support during labor ( p &lt; 0.001). Maternal age ( p &lt; 0.001), parity ( p &lt; 0.001), migration background ( p &lt; 0.001), mode of delivery ( p &lt; 0.001) and assistance during labor ( p &lt; 0.001) were parameters significantly influential on the PTSD symptom level measured by the IES-R. Conclusions Maternal PTSD prevalence after childbirth seems to be quite rare with 2.9%. Nevertheless, recent findings assume that this prevalence may only represent the “tip of the iceberg”. PTSD after childbirth should not be underestimated. As PTSD depends on personal vulnerability and existing risk factors, patients at risk have to be detected before childbirth, which appears to be challenging especially for obstetric and family care professionals.",801

The Association Between Posttraumatic Growth and Quality of Life Among Low-Grade Gliomas Patients in China,"Background Diagnosing with low-grade gliomas (LGGs) can be a very shocking and stressful experience, a traumatic event potentially leading to the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG). Understanding how patients cognitively and behaviorally response to their diagnosing is also important to postoperative treatment. Thus, the current study explored the association between PTG and quality of life (QoL) of Chinese patients with LGGs. The moderation effects of coping strategies and PTSS on the relationship between PTG and QoL have been examined as well. Method PTSS, PTG, coping strategies, and QoL were measured by using self-report surveys. Three hundred and thirty patients completed surveys approximately one month after surgery. We used three multiple regression models and added interaction terms in these models to test the moderation effects of PTSS and coping strategies on the relationship between PTG and QoL. Results The results of hierarchical multiple regression suggested that PTG significantly predicted QoL, both PTSS and coping strategies moderated the association between PTG and QoL. Specifically, the association between PTG and QoL for patients who have non-significant PTSS is stronger than those who have significant PTSS. Furthermore, as the score of Avoidant Coping increases, the association between PTG and QoL becomes weaker. Conclusions PTG may help to improve the QoL of LGGs patients, but PTSS and Avoidant Coping impeded the positive effect of PTG on QoL.",802

Their frequency and severity range from normal dissociation to pathological fragmentation of identity. High rates of dissociation and Dissociative Disorders have been documented in both community and clinical samples. Trauma, especially chronic trauma, plays an essential role in the development and long-term presence of dissociative symptoms. During overwhelming and often traumatic experiences dissociation protects the individual by psychological detachment from the unbearable reality. Chronic dissociative experiences might cause severe disintegration of the individual’s mental experience. The Trauma Model suggests that dissociation is a psychobiological response which enables survival during and after the traumatic event. The Developmental Model is based on an assumption that disturbed attachment, especially early interpersonal trauma, might lead to the development of severe dissociation in children and adolescents, often lasting into adulthood. Diagnostic systems include three diagnoses that deal with the specific relationship between trauma and dissociation. Two of these diagnoses have been recognized recently - Complex PTSD (ICD-11) and the Dissociative Subtype of PTSD (DSM-5); one has already been established - the Dissociative Identity Disorder. Patients with Dissociative Disorders suffer from a range of symptoms. The most severe symptoms include chronic suicidal ideation and frequent suicide attempts. Therefore, researchers and clinicians should routinely assess dissociation in their everyday practice. In patients with Dissociative Disorders, the main treatment goal is the integration of their mental experience.",803

However, little attention is given on the psychological consequences among these professionals. This study has explored the frequency of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among them after the Nepal earthquake 2015.A descriptive cross sectional study was carried out amongst the medical professionals at Manmohan Memorial Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu to assess the PTSD among them after the Nepal earthquake 2015. Two months after the post disaster the standard PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL 5) was administered to medical personnel of a hospital(n=64) along with demographic features, disaster related experience and working hours. PTSD was defined by two ways: 1.using DSM V diagnostic criteria (the presence of at least one intrusion, one avoidance, two negative alterations in cognitions/mood and two alterations in arousal and reactivity symptoms); and 2. a cutoff score of 30.The overall prevalence of PTSD was 21.9% and 17.1% using cutoff score and diagnostic criteria respectively. Females scored significantly higher than males. No significant difference was observed according to age, marital status, profession, previous disaster experience, tragic events with relatives. Those who were present in the hospital during the initial influx of victims, witnessed patients suffering, worked extra time were at significantly high risk for development of PTSD.This study suggest that PTSD is highly prevalent among healthcare professionals after disaster management and therefore it highlights the need for targeted interventions to specific staff who respond to large disasters to reduce the psychological burden.",804
https://openalex.org/W4311689919,10.1007/s40653-022-00503-z,The Rising of the Shield Hero. Development of the Post-Traumatic Symptom Questionnaire (PTSQ) and Assessment of the Protective Effect of Self-Esteem from Trauma-Related Anxiety and Depression,"Adverse life events such as life-threatening accidents, domestic and/or sexual violence, organic diseases (i.e., cancer), or COVID-19 can have a strong traumatic impact – generating reactions as intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal, and avoidance. Indeed, the traumatic impact of COVID-19 seems to lead individuals to experience anxiety and depression. However, the Anxiety-Buffer Hypothesis suggests that self-esteem could be considered a shield (buffer) against traumatic experiences and their outcomes (i.e., anxiety and depression). The present study has two objectives. First, to develop a measure of the impact of the traumatic event considering the aforementioned reactions. Second, to test the process – triggered by COVID19-related traumatic experience – in which self-esteem buffers the path that leads to anxiety and depression. In Study 1 (N = 353), the Post-Traumatic Symptom Questionnaire (PTSQ) was developed and a deep investigation of its psychometric properties was conducted. In Study 2 (N = 445), a structural equation model with latent variables was performed to assess the buffering effect of self-esteem. The PTSQ has excellent fit indices and psychometric properties. According to the ABH, results confirm the buffering effect of self-esteem in the relationships between traumatic symptoms and both anxiety and depression. On the one hand, the PTSQ is a solid and reliable instrument. On the other hand, that self-esteem is a protective factor against anxiety and depression related to a traumatic experience – such as COVID-19. Targeted psychological interventions should be implemented to minimize the psychological burden of the illness while promoting adaptation and positive aspects of oneself.",805
https://openalex.org/W2176386785,10.14264/uql.2015.937,Posttraumatic stress disorder in a therapeutic community for substance use disorders: an evaluation of the influence,"The purpose of this body of research is twofold. First, to investigate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a sample of adults undergoing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment in a therapeutic community (TC) and, second, to apply major psychological theories to help understand the nature of this comorbidity in ways that inform treatment. The focal theories of this research are: emotion dysregulation (Gratz & Roemer, 2004), and revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (rRST; Corr, 2008; Gray & McNaughton, 2000). Rash Impulsiveness (Dawe & Loxton, 2004) will be included as an important dimension of rRST that has been consistently linked to substance misuse. Chapter 1 presents an overview of research related to the thesis as a whole. In Chapter Two, a systematic review of TC literature reveals that PTSD is under-researched in the TC context, despite a high prevalence of individuals with PTSD - SUD comorbidity. In order to establish the prevalence of PTSD in our TC sample, Chapter Three describes a psychometric validation of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C) in a sample of 120 adults undergoing treatment in a TC. The PCL-C was found to have good model fit (χ2 (114) = 216.340, p < .001, RMSEA = .087, CI .069-.104, CMIN/df = 1.898, CFI = .923 and SRMR = .0577), and high reliability, α = .944, n = 120. In Chapter Four, the prevalence and process of change of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during treatment, and 3 months following treatment, was investigated. A majority, 64%, of the sample met the Veteran's Affairs (VA) suggested PCL-C diagnostic threshold for PTSD at the start of rehabilitation. The severity of PTSS significantly influenced the length of stay in treatment (r = -.23, p < .01). Nevertheless, for those who stayed in treatment, PTSS significantly decreased during the course of treatment, t (21) = 3.17, p <.01, d = .67. In Chapter Five, correlational analyses revealed that PTSS was positively related to all six facets of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation (DERS) scale reported at early treatment (r = .31 to .72, p < .00). Furthermore, the correlations between PTSS and two of the facets of rRST, BAS and fight-flight-freeze sensitivity (FFFS), were significantly correlated (r = -.23 and .49, p < .01, respectively). BAS sensitivity was shown to negatively correlate with PTSS, indicating that lower BAS sensitivity related to higher PTS severity. No relationship was found between the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) and PTSS. Finally, Rash Impulsivity significantly correlated with PTSS at intake, r = .50, p < .00. Contrary to hypotheses, and previous research, Rash Impulsivity did not significantly correlate with retention. Theoretical mechanisms linking PTSS and substance misuse were investigated further, with tests of theoretical models in which individual difference factors (facets of the rRST) were related to retention and outcomes from treatment, and facets of emotional dysregulation were tested as mediators of this relationship. Upon investigation through linear regression, no suitable variable was found the mediate the relationship between PTSS and retention. The final moderated mediated model, therefore, was not suitable for this population. Limited moderation, though, occurred between the two facets of rRST and retention. Specifically, investigation of the simple slopes showed that FFFS and Rash Impulsivity both moderate the relationship between PTSD and retention at high (+1 SD) and mean scores. These findings indicate that high levels of both facets do interact with PTSD to negatively influence treatment retention. The null findings for both mediation and the moderated mediation model contradict previous research, and may be due to homogeneity in scores across the population. Overall, some implications for treatment can be extrapolated. First, PTSD is highly prevalent in the TC population, and should be assessed using psychometrically valid measures, such as the PCL-C, and addressed in treatment. Second, treatment for SUD does not exacerbate PTSD; on the contrary, PTSS significantly decreased during TC treatment. Finally, as there is solid theoretical support to suggest an influence of emotion dysregulation and Rash Impulsiveness on retention and outcomes, more research needs to be conducted on the role of these two constructs with the intent of creating a better suited rehabilitation program for individuals with a PTSD - SUD comorbidity.",806

The contrasting good-enough level model suggests that patients improve at different rates in therapy and discontinue treatment when they are satisfied with their improvement. Support for each theory has been mixed, and many prior studies have relied on samples of patients receiving unstructured treatment approaches. We conducted this study to compare these two theories across two manualized treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Two hundred eighty-four female veterans and military service members with PTSD (Mage = 44.79; 54.6% White non-Hispanic, 6.7% Black non-Hispanic, 37% other) were randomized to receive 10 sessions of prolonged exposure (PE), a trauma-focused therapy, or present-centered therapy (PCT), a non-trauma-focused therapy. Participants completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL) at even-numbered treatment sessions, and the timing of dropout/treatment completion was monitored.The point of highest risk for dropout differed between the treatments, with risk in PE corresponding to the beginning of imaginal exposures. In the PE condition, but not in PCT, a higher number of sessions completed increased the likelihood of achieving reliable clinically significant improvement. Across treatments, the rate of change in PTSD symptoms did not differ according to the number of sessions completed (b = 0.06, p = .687).Findings support the dose-response model of change in psychotherapy. There were notable differences in dropout across the treatment conditions, including rates, timing, and implications for outcomes. These differences likely reflect differences in content between the protocols. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",807

While mutual maintenance between pain and PTSD has been suggested, knowledge on individual differences in the course of these symptoms is needed. The present study aimed to identify trajectories of PTSD symptoms following whiplash and test predictors and functional outcomes of such trajectories. Methods In a prospective cohort design with assessments at baseline (&lt;4 weeks), 3 months, and 6 months post‐injury ( n = 229, whiplash grade I‐ III ), we identified PTSD ‐trajectories using Latent Growth Mixture Modeling. Predictors (pain, fear‐avoidance‐beliefs, pain‐catastrophizing, depression, age, and gender) were tested using multinomial logistic regression, and group mean differences in physical and psychosocial pain‐related disability at 6 months were tested as outcomes after controlling for baseline levels. Results Three trajectories were identified: “Resilient” (75.1%) with little or no PTSD symptoms over time, “Recovering” (10.0%) with high initial PTSD symptom levels, then decreasing substantially, and “Chronic” (14.9%) with high initial PTSD symptom levels and a small increase over time. Initial higher pain and depression levels predicted the recovering and chronic trajectories, while the latter had more pain‐related disability at 6 months compared to both other trajectories. Conclusions Three trajectories were identified, with the chronic trajectory suggesting that a significant subset of people does not recover from PTSD symptoms. This class also reported more pain‐related disability. Pain and depression predicted membership, but did, however, not succeed in differentiating between the two high‐starting trajectories, suggesting that targeting PTSD symptoms may be important to ensure recovery. Significance Distinct recovery patterns after whiplash were identified with a significant subgroup reporting elevated and slightly increasing PTSD symptoms over time, highlighting both recovery variability and the presence of PTSD symptoms in a significant subgroup of individuals with whiplash. This subgroup also displayed enhanced pain‐related disability over time compared to the recovering and resilient subgroups, thereby linking PTSD symptoms to functional pain outcomes over time. These findings suggest that clinicians should be attentive of potential PTSD symptoms in whiplash patients.",808

The DSM-III-R diagnostic classification (American Psychiatric Association), although the best mans for determining post-traumatic stress disorder, represents an ideal example for examining these problems while being, at the same time, a useful model for more exact classifications. In addition, by tackling the problems in this manner one gets a better understanding of the entire model for the occurrence of stress disorders: starting from the objective event, the traumatic experiences, the mediational factors to the appearance of acute and chronic after-effects of stress disorders.",809

Therefore, accurate prediction of chronic PTSD at an early stage is needed. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to precise prediction and interpretation.The study proposes a clinically useful predictive model for PTSD 6-12 months after injury, analyzing the relationship among predictors, and between predictors and outcomes.A ML approach was utilized to train models based on 1167 children and adolescents of nine perspective studies. Demographics, trauma characteristics and acute traumatic stress (ASD) symptoms were used as initial predictors. PTSD diagnosis at six months was derived using DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria. Models were validated on external datasets. Shapley value and partial dependency plot (PDP) were applied to interpret the final model.A random forest model with 13 predictors (age, ethnicity, trauma type, intrusive memories, nightmares, reliving, distress, dissociation, cognitive avoidance, sleep, irritability, hypervigilance and startle) yielded F-scores of.973,0.902 and.961 with training and two external datasets. Shapley values were calculated for individual and grouped predictors. A cumulative effect for intrusion symptoms was observed. PDP showed a non-linear relationship between age and PTSD, and between ASD symptom severity and PTSD. A 43 % difference in the risk between non-minority and minority ethnic groups was detected.A ML model demonstrated excellent classification performance and good potential for clinical utility, using a few easily obtainable variables.

https://openalex.org/W3019394960,,Examining the characteristics of patients who continue participation in vs those who drop out of a PTSD clinical trial,"Background Patients who drop out of clinical trials examining posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may have different characteristics than patients who continue. These characteristics have never been examined in prior PTSD and attrition trials. Our goal was to examine how demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with PTSD impact attrition in a randomized controlled trial. Methods A total of 18 participants were recruited. Data were collected through questionnaires to assess PTSD, depression, and mood disorders. Fisher’s exact test was used to examine the association of various categorical demographic and clinical variables with dropout. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to examine differences in medians. Results The median total PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score was 38 for patients who dropped out and 53 for those who did not. The depression scale total was also lower for the dropout group (7 vs 15). The insomnia index was lower for those who did not remain in the study (15 vs 21). Conclusions Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression, and insomnia were less severe in patients who dropped out compared with those who did not. Larger studies are needed to further examine these findings. This study could help guide future recruitment efforts for clinical trials examining PTSD.",811

Using self-report to establish diagnostic criteria in research has become more common, especially with internet-based research. However, some individuals may construe events as traumatic when they do not meet Criterion A. There has yet to be a test of interrater reliability (IRR) from self-report of traumatic events.Three graduate students in clinical psychology and three licensed psychologists rated Criterion A using the life events checklist (LEC), as well as the three modified LEC versions (specification of up to three index traumas; extension of part 2 of the LEC) aimed to increase IRR. One hundred participants completed each of the four versions of the LEC (N = 400). Bootstrapped permutation tests were used to estimate differences in IRR and to generate 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Overall, findings indicated fair-moderate IRR (Fleiss's kappa) κ = 0.428, 95% CI [0.379, 0.477]. The other versions of the LEC (including additional clarifying questions in part 2 of the LEC and/or opportunities to describe up to three traumas) did not meaningfully increase IRR.Findings indicate that relying on self-report from the LEC alone and/or single-rater assessment of open-text trauma descriptions is not recommended for determining whether a traumatic event meets Criterion A. We conclude that it is critical when collecting self-reported PTSD symptoms to provide a clear description of how Criterion A was assessed, initial agreement between raters, and how disagreements were resolved.

It is possible that development of PTSD symptoms in this cohort is associated with subsequent adverse physical health events. Our objective was to test whether clinically significant PTSD symptoms 30 days postdischarge are associated with increased risk for hospital readmission within 24 months after discharge among patients presenting to the ED for a respiratory or cardiovascular emergency.This was a prospective cohort study conducted between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020, at a U.S. academic medical center, including adult patients presenting with acute respiratory failure or cardiovascular instability requiring a potentially life-sustaining intervention in the ED. PTSD symptoms 30 days postdischarge were measured using the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital readmission over the subsequent 24 months after hospital discharge from the index ED visit.Of the 99 patients included, 73% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63% to 81%) had a hospital readmission within 24 months. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for potential confounders (e.g., age, severity of illness during index ED visit, preexisting comorbid conditions) presence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms at 30 days was independently associated with increased risk for all-cause hospital readmission at 24 months (hazards ratio = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.30 to 3.69). These results remained statistically significant across multiple sensitivity analyses.Hospital readmission is common among survivors of acute respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability, and PTSD symptoms 30 days postdischarge are an independent predictor of hospital readmission. Survivors of medical emergencies may warrant follow-up evaluation for PTSD symptoms, and future research is warranted to better understand the relationship between psychological trauma and hospital readmission.",813

The PCL was revised for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5; Friedman, 2013), and the updated version, the PCL-5, has continued the strong psychometric performance of the original version. To further explore the PCL-5’s psychometric properties, we used item response theory (IRT) to examine item difficulty and discrimination parameters in separate samples of trauma-exposed undergraduates (N = 1213) and community members (N = 367). Considering item difficulty, nightmares, flashbacks, and reckless or self-destructive behavior emerged among the most difficult items across samples and internal avoidance emerged as the least difficult items across samples. In terms of item discrimination, inability to experience positive emotions, detachment from others, diminished interest, and negative emotions emerged as highly discriminating items in both samples, and traumatic amnesia and reckless or self-destructive behavior emerged as the least discriminating items in both samples. These results have implications for the divergent conceptualizations of PTSD in DSM-5 versus International Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition (ICD-11; WHO, 2018).

Results will eventually be evaluated and compared with demographic and medical characteristics. This study is part of a larger research project that aims to (1) determine the prevalence and risk factors for post-traumatic stress symptoms in pediatric hydrocephalus patients and their caregivers; (2) develop a targeted intervention to mitigate its effects and pilot test the intervention. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Caregivers of children with hydrocephalus that have received surgical treatment (CSF shunt or ETV/CPC) were enrolled during routine follow up visit in a pediatric neurosurgery clinic. Caregivers completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Participant responses (n=56) revealed that 57.14% of caregivers indicated that their most traumatic event was directly related to their child’s medical condition. In total, 23.21% of caregivers did not specify their most traumatic event and 1.79% of caregivers indicated that they had never experienced a traumatic event. Median Total Symptom Severity Score was 11 (mean: 15.32±14.92), and scores ranged from 0 to 67; 32.14% of caregivers scored 19 or greater, and 16.07% of caregivers scored 33 or greater, a value suggestive of a provisional diagnosis of PTSD. Severity scores by DSM-V clusters were as follows: cluster B—intrusion symptoms (mean: 4.91±4.77, median: 4, range: 0–20), cluster C—avoidance symptoms (mean: 1.27±1.87, median: 0.5, range: 0–8), cluster D—negative alterations in cognition and mood (mean: 4.86±6.07, median: 2, range: 0–22), and cluster E—alterations in arousal and reactivity (mean: 4.29±4.07, median: 3, range: 0–17). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Preliminary results from this study indicate that post-traumatic stress symptoms are prevalent among caregivers of children with hydrocephalus. These results suggest that psychosocial issues such as PTSS may be a significant problem in need of treatment, that is not traditionally addressed as part of routine care for families of children with hydrocephalus. Characterizing post-traumatic stress symptoms in this population sets the foundation for the development of screening and treatment protocols for post-traumatic stress symptoms in caregivers of children with hydrocephalus. This study is the first step towards fundamentally improving routine clinical care and quality of life for patients with hydrocephalus and their caregivers by understanding and addressing the effects of traumatic stress.",815
https://openalex.org/W2767480806,10.1002/nur.21837,Reliability and validity of the Arabic PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL‐C) in women survivors of intimate partner violence,"ABSTRACT Although intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors are at high risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), PTSD has been considered a disorder specific to Western culture. There is a lack of reliable and valid measures of PTSD symptomology available in the Arab world, and there is still no clear evidence about the underlying factor structure of PTSD symptomology in the context of IPV. Thus, in the present study we investigated the construct validity (factor structure), internal consistency, and concurrent validity of a translated version of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL‐C) in a sample of 299 Saudi women who had experienced IPV. Four competing models (DSM‐IV, Emotional Numbing, Dysphoria, and Dysphoric Arousal) were specified and estimated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The five‐factor Dysphoric Arousal model provided superior fit with the data compared to the alternative models, supporting construct validity of the Arabic PCL‐C. The factor loadings for the five‐factor Dysphoric Arousal model ranged from .31 to .83. A relatively high correlation between the Arabic PCL‐C and Arabic Center for Epidemiologic Studies‐Depression (CES‐D) Scale ( r = .78, p &lt; .05) provided evidence of concurrent validity. The total scale also demonstrated internal consistency reliability ( α = .89). Overall, the study supports the Dysphoric Arousal model in representing PTSD symptoms among IPV survivors, the reliability and validity of the Arabic version of PCL‐C, and the cross‐cultural applicability of PTSD symptoms.",816

Simultaneously, four-, five-, and six-dimensional structures of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), a popular PTSD measure, seem to be more robust than the original three-dimension structure. PTSD and/or specific PTSD symptoms may also evoke adverse cardiometabolic events (e.g., hypertension and obesity) in certain groups. Employing a convenience sample of 58 dental healthcare workers (HCWs) from Russia (mean age = 44.1 ± 12.2 years, 82.8% females), this instrumental study examined the criterion and predictive validity of two IES-R structures: the IES-R3 and the IES-R6 (with added symptoms of numbing, sleep disturbance, and irritability). The subscales of the two IES-R structures expressed good internal consistency, strong correlations with the PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS), hypertension diagnosis, and high body mass index (BMI). In receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, all IES-R models perfectly predicted the PSS (all area under the curve (AUC) values &gt; 0.9, p values &lt; 0.001). The IES-R, both hyperarousal subscales, and the IES-R3 intrusion significantly predicted high BMI. The IES-R did not predict hypertension, but the avoidance subscales and the IES-R3 intrusion significantly predicted it. In conclusion, both IES-R structures can reliably measure PTSD symptoms. The IES-R, hyperarousal, and intrusion may be credible criterion variables for predicting high BMI within PTSD while the intrusion and avoidance subscales may more reliably reflect the cardiovascular consequences of the stress reaction associated with PTSD than the IES-R itself. It is pivotal to verify the results in specific groups (e.g., those with confirmed traumatic exposure and comorbid mood dysfunction). Replication of the study in larger samples, which comprise different physical and metal conditions from heterogenous cultural contexts is necessary.",817

We administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Research Version and the Posttraumatic Stress Scale–Self-report version to a sample of 500 South African community members seeking HIV testing. Of our original sample of 500, 306 (61.2%) reported an index event for posttraumatic stress disorder and 25 (5.0%) met the criteria for this diagnosis. The Posttraumatic Stress Scale–Self-report displayed internal consistency of .95 as measured by Cronbach’s alpha. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as a gold standard, we conducted receiver operating curve analysis among the 306 participants who reported an index traumatic event to determine the extent to which the Posttraumatic Stress Scale–Self-report as a screening instrument successfully discriminated between participants who did and did not meet the diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. The Posttraumatic Stress Scale–Self-report yielded sensitivity of .76 and specificity of .78, with an area under the curve of .837. Positive and negative predictive values were .24 and .97, respectively. Our findings suggest that the Posttraumatic Stress Scale–Self-report may be effectively used to screen for posttraumatic stress disorder among community samples, including persons seeking HIV testing.",818

We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was -24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and -13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation.",819

Linear mixed-effects models evaluated the association between PTSD symptom trajectories and average pain and pain interference outcomes while adjusting for receipt of RA during combat casualty care.Four PTSD trajectories were characterized: resilient, recovering, worsening, and chronic. Differential pain presentations were associated with PTSD symptom trajectories, even after adjusting for receipt of RA. Compared to those with a resilient PTSD symptom trajectory, individuals presenting with chronic PTSD trajectories were estimated to experience average pain scores 2.61 points higher (95% CI: 1.71, 3.14). Participants presenting with worsening (β = 1.42; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.78) and recovering PTSD trajectories (β = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.09, 1.08) were estimated to experience higher average pain scores than participants with resilient PTSD trajectories. Significant differences in pain interference scores were observed across PTSD trajectories. Receiving RA was associated with improved pain up to two years after injury (β = -0.31; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.04), however no statistically significant association was detected between RA and PTSD trajectories.Chronic and worsening PTSD trajectories were associated with greater pain intensity and interference following combat injury even when accounting for receipt of early RA for pain management. These findings underscore the need to jointly assess pain and PTSD symptoms across the trauma care continuum.",820

In addition, we estimated the centrality of the 21 symptoms through network analysis. Each of the symptoms was defined as ordered-categorical variables.Results: The network, with 21 symptoms, demonstrated a strong correlation among difficulty concentrating, reduced awareness of surroundings, and derealization. In addition, reduced awareness of surroundings was estimated as the most central symptom, whereas inability to recall important aspects of trauma was estimated as the least central symptom in the subjects. A community-detection analysis estimated that the 21 PTSD symptoms were organized into three clinically meaning clusters.Conclusion: Although dissociative features have been defined as associative symptoms rather than essential symptoms for the DSM diagnostic criteria, reduced awareness of surroundings may be regarded as the most central symptom in patients in the early phase of PTSD. Thus, evaluation and intervention for dissociative features may be needed in clinical practice and studies on PTSD.",821

Clinical data were extracted from medical records. We ran two bivariate correlation matrices among PTSD symptom dimensions in patients and caregivers. Then, we used multiple linear regression to examine the prospective association of total PCL-S scores with each QoL domain in both patients and caregivers after adjusting for clinically important variables. Next, we explored differential associations between the 4 PTSD symptom dimensions and each QoL domain in both patients and caregivers, adjusting for sex and age.A total of 70 patients (45.7% women, 84.3% white, mean age 52.08 years) and 64 caregivers (64.1% women, 90.6% white, mean age 53.12 years) were included. PTSD symptom dimensions were moderately strongly correlated among patients (r = 0.65-0.79, p < 0.001) and caregivers (r = 0.55-0.78, p < 0.001). For both patients and caregivers, greater PTSD symptom severity was prospectively associated with lower QoL in all domains (β = - 0.289 to - 0.622; p < 0.05). Our exploratory analysis revealed that greater numbing symptoms were associated with lower psychological QoL in patients (β: - 0.397, p = 0.038), and lower physical (β: - 0.409, p = 0.014), psychological (β: - 0.519, p = 0.001), and social QoL (β: - 0.704, p < 0.001) in caregivers. Greater re-experiencing symptoms were associated with lower physical QoL in both patients (β: - 0.422, p = 0.047) and caregivers (β: - 0.4, p = 0.041).Our preliminary results indicated that greater severity of PTSD symptoms, and specifically numbing and re-experiencing symptoms, experienced by patients and caregivers during neuro-ICU admission was predictive of worse 3-month QoL. Continued study is needed to identify treatment targets for PTSD and QoL in this population.",822
https://openalex.org/W4294168349,10.1002/jts.22873,Combining a stellate ganglion block with prolonged exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder: A nonrandomized clinical trial,"Abstract Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is an efficacious treatment for active duty service members and veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, PE is sometimes associated with high dropout rates, limited tolerability, and temporary symptom exacerbation during treatment. Stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs) are an emerging treatment that has the potential to enhance outcomes for PTSD when combined with trauma‐focused psychotherapy. To date, no study of which we are aware has examined the potential additive benefits of SGB injections when administered in conjunction with trauma‐focused behavioral treatment for PTSD. Thus, we conducted a nonrandomized clinical trial to evaluate the use of an SGB combined with massed PE therapy for combat‐related PTSD. Participants ( N = 12) were treated with 10 daily 90‐min PE sessions delivered over 2 weeks and received a single SGB injection between Sessions 1 and 2. PE sessions lasted 90 min each. Participants reported a mean posttreatment PTSD symptom reduction of 32 points on the PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5), Hedges’ g s = 1.28–2.80. Most participants (90.9%) demonstrated clinically significant change on the PCL‐5 (i.e., ≥10 points) by the final treatment session and 50.0% no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD per the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale for DSM‐5 at 1‐month follow‐up. Adverse events for the combined treatment were consistent with those previously reported for standalone SGB and PE. This combined treatment approach provides promising results for improving the tolerability of trauma‐focused therapies, reducing symptom severity, and increasing PTSD remission rates.",823

The questions on this scale reflect the corresponding clusters ofPTSD symptoms according to the DSM-5 classification. Clinical-psychopathological andstatistical methods were also used.Using a screening test, it was established that the serviceman experienced severepsychological trauma related to the war, the memories of which are still «unrelenting».Using the NADS test, the patient was diagnosed with clinically expressed anxiety (14points) and subclinical depression (10 points). Interpreting the results of the study interms of clinically significant symptoms, in accordance with the PCL-5 scale, it wasconcluded that according to the total number of points and the sum of points calculatedby clusters of symptoms, the serviceman has post-traumatic stress disorder.

However, the unique contribution of physical activity within these intensive TFT programmes has never been investigated in a controlled manner.This randomized controlled trial will investigate the effectiveness of physical activity added to an intensive TFT programme. In addition, the study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the effects of physical activity on the change in PTSD symptoms.Individuals with PTSD (N = 120) will be randomly allocated to two conditions: a physical activity or a non-physical active control condition. All participants will receive the same intensive TFT lasting eight days within two consecutive weeks, in which daily prolonged exposure and EMDR therapy sessions, and psycho-education are combined. The amount of physical activity will differ per condition. While the physical activity condition induces daily physical activities with moderate intensity, in the non-physical active control condition no physical activity is prescribed; but instead, a controlled mixture of guided (creative) tasks is performed. The two primary outcome measures are change in PTSD symptoms from pre- to post-treatment and at six months follow-up, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Additionally, self-reported sleep problems, depressive symptoms, emotion regulation, dissociation symptoms and anxiety sensitivity will be measured as potential underlying mechanisms.This study will contribute to the research field of augmentation strategies for PTSD treatment by investigating the effectiveness of physical activity added to intensive TFT.This trial is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (Trial NL9120).Antecedentes: Se han desarrollado para personas con TEPT nuevos programas de tratamiento intensivos centrados en trauma (TFT por sus siglas en inglés) que incorporan actividad física. Sin embargo, la contribución única de la actividad física dentro de estos programas de TFT intensivos nunca se ha investigado de manera controlada.Objetivos: Este ensayo controlado aleatorizado investigará la efectividad de la actividad física agregada a un programa intensivo de TFT. Además, el estudio tiene como objetivo investigar los mecanismos subyacentes de los efectos de la actividad física sobre el cambio en los síntomas de TEPT.Métodos: Las personas con TEPT serán asignadas en forma aleatoria a dos condiciones: una actividad física o una condición de control activo no físico. Todos los participantes recibirán la misma TFT intensiva que durará 8 días dentro de dos semanas consecutivas, en las que se combinarán diariamente la exposición prolongada y las sesiones de terapia EMDR y psicoeducación. La cantidad de actividad física diferirá según la condición. Mientras que la condición de actividad física induce actividades físicas diarias de moderada intensidad, en la condición de control activo no físico no se prescribe actividad física, sino que se realiza una mezcla controlada de tareas guiadas (creativa). Las dos medidas de resultado primarias son el cambio en los síntomas de TEPT antes y después del tratamiento y a los seis meses de seguimiento, medidos con la Escala de TEPT administrada por el clínico (CAPS-5) y la Lista de verificación de TEPT del DSM-5 (PCL-5). Adicionalmente, los problemas del sueño autoinformados, los síntomas depresivos, la regulación de emociones, los síntomas disociativos y la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se medirán como potenciales mecanismos subyacentes.Conclusiones: Este estudio contribuirá al campo de la investigación de las estrategias de potenciación para el tratamiento del TEPT al investigar la efectividad de la actividad física agregada a la TFT intensiva.Registro de ensayo: este ensayo esta registrado en el Registro de ensayos de los Países Bajos (ensayo NL 9120).背景: 已经为 PTSD 患者开发了包含身体活动的全新聚焦创伤强化治疗 (TFT) 计划。然而, 体育活动在这些强化TFT 计划中的独特贡献从未被以受控的方式研究过。目的: 本随机对照试验将考查添加到强化 TFT 计划中的身体活动的有效性。此外, 本研究旨在考查体育活动对 PTSD 症状变化影响的潜在机制。方法: 患有 PTSD 的个体 (N = 120) 将被随机分配到两个条件:身体活动或非身体活动控制条件。所有参与者将在连续两周内接受持续八天的相同强化 TFT, 结合了日常延长暴露和 EMDR 治疗以及心理教育。身体活动量会因情况而异。虽然身体活动条件诱发中等强度的日常体力活动, 在非体力活动控制条件下, 不指定体力活动, 而是执行指导性 (创造性) 任务的受控混合。两个主要结果指标是从治疗前到治疗后以及六个月随访时用临床用PTSD 量表 (CAPS-5) 和 DSM-5 PTSD 检查表 (PCL-5) 测量的 PTSD 症状改变。此外, 自我报告的睡眠问题, 抑郁症状, 情绪调节, 分离症状和焦虑敏感性将作为可能的潜在机制进行测量。结论: 本研究将通过考查添加到强化 TFT 的身体活动的有效性, 为 PTSD 治疗增强策略的研究领域做出贡献。试验注册:该试验已在荷兰试验注册中心 (Trial NL9120) 登记。.",825

The current study aimed to demonstrate the reliability and validity of the South Korean version of the DAR-5 (DAR-5-K). The DAR-5 is a single scale with 5 items which measures posttraumatic anger. The DAR-5 is composed of five items that measure anger frequency, intensity, duration, aggression, and its interference with social relations. Methods Data were collected from 814 South Korean adults who had experienced traumatic events and participated in the study and analyzed via the combination of exploratory factor analysis ( n = 405) and confirmatory factor analysis (n = 409). Results Results supported the one-factor structure, as reported in previous validation studies. The scale demonstrated robust internal reliability and concurrent validity with measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. The DAR-5 cut-off score of 12 that was established in the original validation study successfully differentiated high from low scorers with regard to PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. Conclusion The results confirm that the DAR-5-K is a brief and psychometrically robust measure of anger that can be used to examine South Korean adults who have experienced traumatic events.",826

Few longitudinal studies have quantified this relationship so the evidence is limited regarding the potential benefit PTG may have on post-traumatic adjustment and whether differences between ethnic groups exist. Methods The current study attempts to fill a substantial gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between PTG and PTSD symptom clusters longitudinally using a nationally representative cohort of 1613 Israelis and Palestinian Citizens of Israel (PCI) interviewed via telephone on three measurement occasions during one year. Latent cross-lagged structural models estimated the relationship between PTG and each PTSD symptom cluster, derived from confirmatory factor analysis, representing latent and statistically invariant PTSD symptom factors, best representing PTSD for both ethnic groups. Results PTG was not associated with less PTSD symptom severity in any of the four PTSD clusters, for Jews and PCI. In contrast, PTSD symptom severity assessed earlier was related to later reported PTG in both groups. Conclusions This study demonstrates that PTSD symptoms contribute to greater reported PTG, but that PTG does not provide a salutatory benefit by reducing symptoms of PTSD.",828

Patients ( n = 97) with critical illness polyneuropathy or critical illness myopathy were interviewed via the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition . The diagnosis of the acute stress disorder was assessed within 1 month (t1), the diagnosis of PTSD at 3 (t2) and 6 (t3) months after transfer from the acute care ICU to the post-acute ICU. Patients showing a delayed-onset or persistent course of PTSD were subsumed in one group; 24.7% ( n = 24) showed a delayed-onset PTSD. Significant risk factors were as follows: the severity of the medical illness, the perceived fear of dying at the ICU, the number of traumatic memories from the ICU, and the presence of a coronary heart disease. Every fourth patient with CCI showed a delayed-onset PTSD up to 6 months after the ICU treatment. Markers for a delayed-onset PTSD should already be assessed at the time of discharge from the ICU.",829

This study is the first to explore mental health trajectories and associated predictors in military members across the first 3-4 years of their career to provide evidence to inform early interventions.This prospective cohort study surveyed Australian Defence personnel (n = 5329) at four time-points across their early military career. Core outcomes were psychological distress (K10+) and posttraumatic stress symptoms [four-item PTSD Checklist (PCL-4)] with intra-individual, organizational and event-related trajectory predictors. Latent class growth analyses (LCGAs) identified subgroups within the sample that followed similar longitudinal trajectories for these outcomes, while conditional LCGAs examined the variables that influenced patterns of mental health.Three clear trajectories emerged for psychological distress: resilient (84.0%), worsening (9.6%) and recovery (6.5%). Four trajectories emerged for post-traumatic stress, including resilient (82.5%), recovery (9.6%), worsening (5.8%) and chronic subthreshold (2.3%) trajectories. Across both outcomes, prior trauma exposure alongside modifiable factors, such as maladaptive coping styles, and increased anger and sleep difficulties were associated with the worsening and chronic subthreshold trajectories, whilst members in the resilient trajectories were more likely to be male, report increased social support from family/friends and Australian Defence Force (ADF) sources, and use adaptive coping styles.The emergence of symptoms of mental health problems occurs early in the military lifecycle for a significant proportion of individuals. Modifiable factors associated with wellbeing identified in this study are ideal targets for intervention, and should be embedded and consolidated throughout the military career.",830

First-ever ischemic stroke patients were surveyed 9–13 months after hospitalization at the Charité University Medical Center. Stroke-induced PTSD symptoms were measured using the Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). Prior traumatization together with past PTSD symptoms was assessed retrospectively with the Brief Trauma Questionnaire (BTQ) and the 7-item Short Screening Scale for PTSD. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The Short Form (SF)-36 was used to evaluate physical and mental health outcomes. We received 258 responses from 636 eligible patients (~41%). Based on respondents' scores on the IES-R, the prevalence of probable PTSD due to the stroke event was 11% in our sample. Female sex and younger age were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms. Psychological endpoints did not differ between patients who denied prior trauma exposure and those who reported earlier trauma exposure but denied subsequent PTSD symptoms. However, a history of trauma exposure in tandem with endorsing subsequent PTSD symptoms was linked with significantly increased post-stroke PTSD and depressive symptoms together with decreased psychological well-being. Self-reported physical health did not differ across groups. Younger age, being a woman, and having developed PTSD symptoms in the aftermath of a prior trauma were associated with adverse psychological outcomes after stroke.",831

On the other hand, pain as assessed by the Faces Pain Rating Scale was not a significant independent predictor of PTSS.The CAS may be a useful addition to existing screening tools for PTSS among children. Additional research is warranted to understand underlying mechanisms linking acute pain and PTSS to improve assessment, prevention, and treatment approaches and promote optimal recovery after pediatric injury.",832

The World Trade Center Health Registry (Registry) provides a unique opportunity to study the association between PTSD and mortality among a population exposed to the World Trade Center attacks in New York, New York, on September 11, 2001 (9/11).To assess whether 9/11-related probable PTSD (PTSD) is associated with increased mortality risk, as well as whether this association differs when including repeated measures of PTSD over time vs a single baseline assessment.A longitudinal cohort study of 63 666 Registry enrollees (29 270 responders and 34 396 civilians) was conducted from September 5, 2003, to December 31, 2016, with PTSD assessments at baseline (wave 1: 2003-2004) and 3 follow-up time points (wave 2: 2006-2007, wave 3: 2011-2012, wave 4: 2015-2016).

Baseline PTSD was defined using wave 1 PCL-S, and time-varying PTSD was defined using the PCL-S assessments from all 4 waves.Mortality outcomes were ascertained through National Death Index linkage from 2003 to 2016 and defined as all-cause, cardiovascular, and external-cause mortality.Of 63 666 enrollees (38 883 men [61.1%]; mean [SD] age at 9/11, 40.4 [10.4] years), 6689 (10.8%) had PTSD at baseline (responders: 2702 [9.5%]; civilians: 3987 [12.0%]). Participants who were middle aged (2022 [12.5%]), female (3299 [13.8%]), non-Latino black (1295 [17.0%]), or Latino (1835 [22.2%]) were more likely to have PTSD. During follow-up, 2349 enrollees died (including 230 external-cause deaths and 487 cardiovascular deaths). Among all enrollees in time-varying analyses, PTSD was associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and external-cause mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) of greater magnitude compared with analyses examining baseline PTSD. Among responders, time-varying PTSD was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (AHR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.58-2.32), cardiovascular (AHR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.25-3.04), and external-cause (AHR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.47-3.91) mortality. Among civilians, time-varying PTSD was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (AHR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.28-1.85), cardiovascular (AHR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.15-2.58), and external-cause (AHR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.06-4.19) mortality.The risk of mortality differed in examination of baseline PTSD vs repeated measures of PTSD over time, suggesting that longitudinal data should be used where possible. Comparable findings between responders and civilians suggest that 9/11-related PTSD is associated with an increased mortality risk.",833

However, little is known about the long-term outcome expectations following the end of the treatment.The aim of this study was to evaluate patients' long-term outcome expectations after trauma-focused post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) psychotherapy in a single group effectiveness study.Twenty participants with various traumatic experiences who completed the Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (BEPP) and all the assessments were included into the study. Self-report measures were used to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Subjective Units of Distress Scale was used to measure long-term outcome expectations at post-treatment, asking participants to measure the expected distress in 6 months following the treatment. Assessments at 6-month follow-up were used to estimate the accuracy of patients' expectations of their distress at previous post-treatment assessment.Significant decline of PTSD symptoms at post-treatment with large effect sizes was observed. At post-treatment assessment participants expected significant improvement of their condition in 6 months after the treatment. However, therapeutic effects remained stable at the 6-month follow-up.It is concluded that the PTSD patients, even after successful trauma-focused treatment, tend to expect further significant positive changes. However, therapeutic effects were stable half a year after the psychotherapy, and patients tend to have false expectations about further improvement of their condition.",834

This study aims to examine the genetics of PTSD in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) to identify potential genetic factors involved in the development of PTSD.The CLSA sample was screened for primary (PTSD status) and secondary outcomes (avoidance, detachment, guardedness, and nightmares) based on the Primary Care PTSD Screen Scale (PC-PTSD). After GWAS quality control and whole-genome imputation, single-marker, gene-based, and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses were performed.Based on available genotype and phenotype data, N = 16,535 individuals were selected for the analyses. While genome-wide analyses did not show significant findings for our primary and secondary outcomes, PRS analyses showed variable levels of association between PC-PTSD items with trauma, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, educational attainment, and insomnia (p &lt; 5e-4).This is the first GWAS of PTSD status and individual PC-PTSD items in a population sample of older adults from Canada. This study was also able to replicate findings from previous studies.

In addition, PTSD patients was classified using ‘pattern identification for jing ji and zheng chong''.
Methods: Questionnaires such as the primary care PTSD screen for DSM-5(PC-PTSD-5), Korean version of PTSD checklist-5 (PCL-5-K), and the instrument of pattern identification for jing ji and zheng chong were conducted on 195 patients within 3 days to 1 year after traffic accidents. Patients were recruited from six medical institutions. Collected data were used to determine the prevalence of acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Results: On PC-PTSD-5, the prevalence was 39.1% for ASD and 50% for PTSD. On PCL-5-K, the prevalence was 20.4% for ASD and 29.3% for PTSD. Satisfying both PC-PTSD-5 and PCL-5-K, the prevalence was 18.2% for ASD and 25.8% for PTSD. As a result of pattern identification for jing ji and zheng chong, ‘weakness of heart and gall bladder type’ accounted for the highest proportions in both ASD and PTSD groups.
Conclusions: In this study, the prevalence was 39.1% for ASD and 50% for PTSD by PC-PTSD-5. Satisfying both PC-PTSD-5 and PCL-5-K, the prevalence was 18.2% for ASD and 25.8% for PTSD. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to analyze the prevalence of ASD and PTSD, the rate of progression from ASD to PTSD, and the type of pattern identification.",836

The aim of the present study was to extend research on temporal associations between emotion dysregulation and PTSD in a sample of individuals recruited from hospital emergency departments soon after a traumatic event. Adult participants (N = 85; 62.4% female) completed self-report measures of emotion dysregulation and PTSD symptoms within 2 weeks of experiencing a traumatic event. Symptoms of PTSD were assessed approximately 3 months posttrauma. The results of a hierarchical linear regression analysis demonstrated that the inclusion of emotion dysregulation accounted for a significant amount of unique variance, β = .23, ΔR2 = .04, p = .042, in 3-month PTSD symptom severity over and above other risk factors and baseline PTSD symptoms. No specific facet of emotion dysregulation emerged as a significant predictor of 3-month PTSD symptoms when all facets were included on the same step of the model, βs = -.04-.33, ps = .133-.954. These results demonstrate that posttraumatic emotion dysregulation may predict PTSD symptoms 3 months after trauma exposure. These findings are consistent with a growing body of literature that speaks to the relevance of emotional processes to the onset and maintenance of PTSD following exposure to a traumatic event.",837

All patients admitted to Leeds General Infirmary MTC were approached for inclusion in the study over a three-month period. The PAS was administered to all participants at baseline. Following discharge, patients were sent two validated psychological measures via post, the Impact of Events Scale - Revised (IES-R) and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation System (CORE-10). Relationships between continuous variables were examined using a Spearman's rank test (SR). The diagnostic accuracy of the different psychological screening systems was examined and compared using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis.Eighty-two patients completed the PAS, 26 of whom had been referred to clinical psychology and 56 who were not. Fifty-seven of these patients (70%) returned follow-up IES-R and CORE-10 data, 20 who had been referred to psychology and 37 who had not. The PAS-P score recorded shortly after admission correlated strongly with the CORE-10 (SR rs 0.54, p<0.0001) and IES-R (SR rs 0.63, p<0.0001) scores recorded at early follow up. A PAS-P of more than 10 predicted the development of PTSD symptoms (IES-R 33 or more) or moderate global psychological distress (CORE-10 15 or more) with 72% sensitivity and 71% specificity. To identify patients who went on to develop psychological symptoms according to either measure (IES-R 33 or more or CORE-10 15 or more), the PAS-P was more sensitive than clinician referral (71% vs 52%, p<0.05) with similar specificity (72% vs 75%, p=0.78).In an unselected group of trauma inpatients treated in a MTC, the PAS is an effective means of identifying those who are likely to go on to suffer PTSD symptoms or psychological distress. It may useful to use the PAS as a measure to formalise psychology referrals.",838
https://openalex.org/W2810067940,,Variations in PTSD characteristics among trauma-exposed urban black and non-black youth,"Introduction: The main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychological therapies and medication. Traumatic events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and seeking professional help is often the only way of effectively treating PTSD. It's possible for PTSD to be successfully treated many years after the traumatic event or events occurred, which means it's never too late to seek help.

Before having treatment for PTSD, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs. Your GP will often carry out an initial assessment, but you'll be referred to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment if you have had symptoms of PTSD for more than 4 weeks or your symptoms are severe. There are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have PTSD, such as a psychologist, community psychiatric nurse or psychiatrist. If you have mild symptoms of PTSD, or you have had symptoms for less than 4 weeks, an approach called watchful waiting may be recommended. Watchful waiting involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse.",839

At the same time, self-report measures of PTSD tend to be over-inclusive within this specific population due to the high symptom overlap resulting in potential false positives. There is a need for an updated PTSD screening tools with a proper validation against clinical interviews according to the recently published 11th revision of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Objective: The present study aimed to validate the Danish International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) PTSD part in a sample of trauma-exposed chronic pain patients. Method: The ITQ was validated using a clinician-rated diagnostic interview of ICD-11 PTSD among chronic pain patients exposed to accident or work-related trauma (N = 40). Construct validity, concurrent and discriminant validity was investigated using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and correlation analysis, respectively. Three CFA models of ITQ PTSD part were tested in a sample of trauma-exposed chronic pain patients (N = 1,017) and a subsample of chronic pain patients exposed to accident or work-related trauma only (n = 367). Results: Diagnostic consistency between the six ICD-11 PTSD symptoms derived from the ITQ and the clinical interview (κ = .59) and the overall accuracy of the scale (AUC = .90) were good. The Danish ITQ showed excellent construct, concurrent and discriminant validity. The ICD-11 three factor PTSD model had excellent fit in both the full sample and the subsample of traffic and work-related accidents. Conclusions: The results indicate that the ITQ also has good psychometric properties in patients with chronic pain.Antecedentes: La prevalencia estimada del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) como comorbilidad es alta en los pacientes con dolor crónico expuestos a trauma. Asimismo, las mediciones por autorreporte del TEPT suelen ser en exceso incluyentes para este tipo de población debido a que existe una alta superposición de los síntomas, lo que resulta en potenciales resultados falsos positivos. Existe la necesidad de actualizar las herramientas de tamizaje del TEPT con una validación adecuada y acorde con las entrevistas clínicas basadas en la recientemente publicada 11° revisión de la Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (CIE-11).Objetivo: El objetivo de este estudio fue el de validar la sección del TEPT del Cuestionario Internacional de Trauma danés (ITQ, por sus siglas en inglés) en una muestra de personas con dolor crónico expuestas a trauma.Método: Se validó el ITQ empleando una entrevista diagnóstica para el TEPT según la CIE-11 calificada por un clínico en pacientes con dolor crónico expuestos a accidentes o a traumas relacionados con el trabajo (N = 40). Se investigaron la validez del constructo y la validez concurrente y discriminativa mediante el empleo de análisis confirmatorios de factor (ACF) y análisis de correlación, respectivamente. Los tres modelos realizados mediante ACF de la sección del TEPT del ITQ fueron luego evaluados en una muestra de pacientes con dolor crónico expuestos a trauma (N = 1.017) y en un grupo de esta muestra de pacientes con dolor crónico expuestos únicamente a accidentes o a traumas relacionados con el trabajo (N = 367).Resultados: Tanto la consistencia diagnóstica entre seis síntomas del TEPT basados en la CIE-11 obtenidos mediante el ITQ y la entrevista diagnóstica (k = .59) como la precisión general de la escala (AUC = .90) fueron buenas. El ITQ danés mostró tanto una validez del constructo como una validez concurrente y discriminativa excelentes. El modelo de tres factores para el TEPT según la CIE-11 tiene una excelente adaptación tanto en la muestra completa como en el grupo tomado de la muestra para accidentes o traumas relacionados con el trabajo.Conclusiones: Los resultados indican que el ITQ también posee propiedades psicométricas buenas en pacientes con dolor crónico.背景: 在遭受创伤的慢性疼痛患者中, 并发的创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 的估计患病率很高。同时, 在此特定人群中, PTSD的自我报告测量倾向于纳入过多, 由于高度的症状重叠导致潜在的假阳性。根据世界卫生组织最近发布的第11版《国际疾病分类》 (ICD-11), 需要一种经过更新的PTSD筛查工具, 并对临床访谈进行适当验证。目的: 本研究旨在验证创伤暴露的慢性疼痛患者样本中的丹麦国际创伤问卷 (ITQ) PTSD部分。方法: 使用临床医师评定的ICD-11 PTSD诊断性访谈对暴露于事故或工作相关创伤的慢性疼痛患者进行了ITQ验证 (N = 40) 。分别使用验证性因子分析 (CFA) 和相关性分析研究了结构效度, 同时效度和区分效度。在创伤暴露的慢性疼痛患者的样本 (N = 1,017) 和仅暴露于事故或工作相关创伤的慢性疼痛患者的子样本 (n = 367) 中检验了三种ITFA PTSD部分的CFA模型。结果: 从ITQ和临床访谈得出的六个ICD-11 PTSD症状之间的诊断一致性 (k = .59) 和量表的总体准确性 (AUC = .90) 良好。丹麦语ITQ表现出出色的构念, 同时性和区分性。 ICD-11三因素PTSD模型非常适合全部样本和交通事故和工作相关事故的子样本。结论: 结果表明, ITQ在慢性疼痛患者中也具有良好的心理测量学特性。.",840

Self-report measures of depressive symptoms, general self-efficacy, and meaning in life were collected, along with clinician-rated symptoms of PTSD.Meaning in life was consistently inversely associated with posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms and symptom clusters cross-sectionally, whereas general self-efficacy was only inversely associated with some aspects of depressive symptoms. Longitudinal analyses further revealed that meaning in life was inversely associated with the cluster D symptoms of PTSD and the cognitive-affective symptoms of depression.Higher meaning in life is associated with less severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms, particularly those related to mood. Additional research is needed to determine whether interventions designed to increase meaning in life attenuate these symptoms.",841

However, the validation of clinical assessment scales, and their latent variable structure, is often derived from cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data, limiting our understanding of how variables interact and reinforce one another. Objectives Using experience sampling methodology (ESM) and analytic approaches optimised for longitudinal data, we assess potential latent variables of commonly-reported symptoms in psychosis, and explore the temporal relationship between them. Methods N=36 participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder provided data for up to one year, as part of the Sleepsight study. Using a smartphone app, participants self-reported clinical symptoms once daily for a mean duration of 323 days (SD: 88), with a response rate of 69%. Symptoms were rated using seven-point Likert scale items. Items included symptoms traditionally implicated in psychosis (feeling “cheerful”, “anxious”, “relaxed”, “irritable”, “sad”, “in control”, “stressed”, “suspicious”, “trouble concentrating”, “preoccupied by thoughts”, “others dislike me”, “confused”, “others influence my thoughts” and “unusual sights and sounds”). We used a sparse PCA (SPCA) model to identify latent variables in the longitudinal data. SPCA has previously been applied to longitudinal ESM data, and was developed to achieve a compromise between the explained variance and the interpretability of the principal components. We then used a multistage exploratory and confirmatory differential time-varying effect model (DTVEM) to explore the temporal relationship between the latent variables. DTVEM generates a standardised β coefficient reflecting the strength of relationship between variables across multiple time lags. Only significant lags (p&lt;0.05) are reported here. Results The SPCA analysis identified five latent variables, explaining 61.4% of the total variance. Tentative interpretation of the SPCA loadings suggested these latent variables corresponded to i) cognitive symptoms, ii) feeling in-control, iii) thought interference and perceptual disturbance, iv) irritability and stress and v) paranoia. Time lag analysis revealed an effect of feeling in-control on subsequent cognitive symptoms (β=-0.19), and of cognitive symptoms on subsequent thought interference and perceptual disturbance (β=0.14). Irritability and stress was also associated with subsequent cognitive symptoms (β=0.09). Conclusions Using longitudinal data, we employ novel methodology to identify potential latent symptoms among commonly reported symptoms in psychosis. We identify five latent symptoms, and elucidate important temporal relationships between them. These findings may inform our understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, potentially offering data-driven simplification of clinical assessment and novel insights for future research.

However, little research has been conducted in non-Western countries to assess this problem. This study aims to fill the void by assessing the lifetime exposure to traumatic events and burden of probable PTSD among university students in Karachi, Pakistan. A cross-sectional study was conducted at four private institutions in Karachi. Self-administered questionnaires were filled out by 320 students. Lifetime exposure and symptoms of PTSD were assessed using modified Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist–Civilian Version (PCL-C) questionnaires, respectively. A PCL-C score of 44 or above was used as cutoff for probable PTSD. Pearson chi-square test was used to assess the association between PTSD and different variables at a level of significance of 5%. Ninety-three percent of the respondents reported having lifetime exposure to at least one traumatic event with sudden unexpected death of a loved one ( n = 187) and assaultive violence ( n = 169) being the commonest reported traumatic events. Positive association for PTSD was seen with enduring physical attacks and motor vehicle accidents. Over a quarter of the students screened positive for probable PTSD, among them almost one third were male and 17% were female. Our results indicate a high exposure to violent events and elevated rates of lifetime PTSD among urban youth. Reduction in violence and better access to mental health facilities is warranted to decrease the health burden of PTSD in Pakistan.",843

We developed and applied the Posttraumatic Counterfactual Comparisons Scale (P-CFC-S), which measures frequency, intensity and affective impact of trauma-related CFC. We further measured trauma history, PTSD symptoms, probable PTSD diagnosis, posttraumatic cognitions, satisfaction with life and basic sociodemographic information. The sample consisted of 556 adults (62.95% female) who had all experienced at least one potentially traumatic event and of whom 15.29% fulfilled a probable PTSD diagnosis. The P-CFC-S yielded adequate internal consistency and a one-factor structure in the explorative factor analysis. CFC were common, and about two-fold more common in individuals with probable PTSD compared to those without. In hierarchical regression analyses, the frequency and intensity in CFC explained a significant amount of variance in PTSD symptoms when potentially confounding variables (i.e. age, gender, posttraumatic cognitions and counterfactual thinking) were accounted for. Our findings suggest that CFC may be an active ingredient in PTSD maintenance. Longitudinal research is needed to examine the dynamics between CFC and PTSD and the hypothesis that CFC is related to cognitive avoidance and/or maladaptive appraisals of trauma meaning.",844
https://openalex.org/W4318066577,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1018111,Causal discovery replicates symptomatic and functional interrelations of posttraumatic stress across five patient populations,"Introduction Approximately half of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may meet criteria for other psychiatric disorders, and PTSD symptoms are associated with diminished health and psychosocial functioning. However, few studies examine the longitudinal progression of PTSD symptoms concurrent with related symptom domains and functional outcomes, such that may neglect important longitudinal patterns of symptom progression beyond PTSD specifically. Methods Therefore, we used longitudinal causal discovery analysis to examine the longitudinal interrelations among PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, substance abuse, and various other domains of functioning in five longitudinal cohorts representing veterans ( n = 241), civilians seeking treatment for anxiety disorders ( n = 79), civilian women seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress and substance abuse ( n = 116), active duty military members assessed 0–90 days following TBI ( n = 243), and civilians with a history of TBI ( n = 43). Results The analyses revealed consistent, directed associations from PTSD symptoms to depressive symptoms, independent longitudinal trajectories of substance use problems, and cascading indirect relations from PTSD symptoms to social functioning through depression as well as direct relations from PTSD symptoms to TBI outcomes. Discussion Our findings suggest PTSD symptoms primarily drive depressive symptoms over time, tend to show independence from substance use symptoms, and may cascade into impairment in other domains. The results have implications for refining conceptualization of PTSD co-morbidity and can inform prognostic and treatment hypotheses about individuals experiencing PTSD symptoms along with co-occurring distress or impairment.",845

After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infection, increased post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rates were described. Methods This single-centred, prospective study aimed to evaluate the rates of PTSD in patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19. Inclusion criteria were COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) or in a standard unit with at least 2 L/min oxygen. Six months post-hospitalization, subjects were assessed for PTSD using a validated screening tool, the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-5 (PCL-5). Results A total of 40 patients were included. No demographic differences between the ICU and non-ICU groups were found. The mean PCL-5 score for the population was 8.85±10. The mean PCL-5 score was 6.7±8 in the ICU group and 10.5±11 in the non-ICU group (P=0.27). We screened one patient with a positive PCL-5 score and one with a possible PCL-5 cluster score. Nine patients had a PCL-5 score of up to 15. Seven patients reported no symptoms. Seven patients accepted a psychological follow-up: one for PTSD, three for possible PTSD and three for other psychological problems. Discussion The PCL-5 tool can be used by lung physicians during consultations to identify patients for whom follow-up mental health assessment and treatment for PTSD are warranted. Conclusion Lung physicians should be aware of the risk of PTSD in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and ensure appropriate screening and follow-up care.",846

However, the clinical implications of findings reported to date remain unclear. To date, no study has been conducted to determine meaningful cut-scores on measures of catastrophizing indicative of the heightened risk of mental health comorbidity. One objective of the present study was to identify the cut-score on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) indicative of the heightened risk of the comorbidity of depression and PTSD. A second objective was to determine whether mental health comorbidity mediated the relationship between catastrophizing and occupational disability. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of 143 individuals with whiplash injuries. Pain severity, pain catastrophizing, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed after admission to a rehabilitation program. Mental health comorbidity was operationally defined as obtaining a score above the clinical threshold on measures of depressive and/or post-traumatic stress symptom severity. Results: A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a PCS score of 22 best distinguished between participants with and without mental health comorbidity. Results also revealed that mental health comorbidity mediated the relationship between catastrophizing and occupational disability. Discussion: The findings suggest that a score of ≥22 on the PCS should alert clinicians to the possibility that patients might also be experiencing clinically significant symptoms of depression or PTSD. Greater attention to the detection and treatment of mental health conditions associated with whiplash injury might contribute to more positive recovery outcomes.",847

Therefore, the aim of this study was to create and examine the validity of alternative CBCL-PTSD subscales and compare them to the existing CBCL-PTSD subscale based on the DSM-5 PTSD diagnostic criteria for children 6 years and younger. Further, the CBCL-PTSD subscales were examined regarding their usefulness in screening for posttraumatic stress-related functional impairment. The sample comprised 116 trauma-exposed young children ( M age = 3.42 years, SD age = 1.21 years, female = 49.1%). The psychometric properties of the existing CBCL-PTSD subscale as well as the alternative subscales based on expert rating ( CBCL-PTSD-17 ) and based on variable importance ( CBCL-PTSD-6 ) were evaluated by means of receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values. Area under the curves for all three investigated CBCL-PTSD subscales were good to excellent for PTSD and functional impairment. Further, all three CBCL-PTSD subscales showed high sensitivity for PTSD and functional impairment. Considering the length and the performance of the three investigated subscales, the CBCL-PTSD-6 appears to be a promising and clinically useful CBCL-PTSD subscale as a screener for PTSD and functional impairment due to the easiest and most practicable application. For purposes of discriminant validation of the CBCL-PTSD-6, young children without a history of trauma should be compared to young children with trauma history.",849

The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which PTSD and depression co-occurred in Serbian general population at baseline and 1 year after the follow-up, as well as how this co-occurrence was associated with sociodemographic factors, personal distress, suicidality and quality of life. Subjects and methods The sample consisted of 159 subjects, who fulfilled the IES criteria for PTSD, and were taken from a larger sample of 640 participants, which was chosen by a random walk technique in five regions of the country affected by major trauma. The assessment was carried out by the following instruments: Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5 (MINI 5), Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (BSC-R), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life Scale (MANSA). The follow-up study was carried out 1 year after the baseline. Results In the initial phase, PTSD was found in 100 out of 159 participants (62.9%), while 81 (51%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MDD. Comorbidity of PTSD and depression was identified in 65 (40.9%) subjects of the sample. After 1 year, PTSD was found in 56 (35.2%) and MDD in 73 (45.9%) participants. Comorbidity of PTSD and depression in the follow-up phase was identified in 41 (25.8%) subjects of the sample. The subjects with comorbidity had significantly higher level of post-traumatic stress symptoms, general psychological distress as well as suicide risk and lower level of quality of life than participants with either condition alone. Conclusion PTSD–depression comorbidity is a common post-traumatic condition. Complex psychopathology, severity of symptoms and their consequences, both at individual and community levels, require attention to be paid to early diagnostics and treatment of affected persons.",850

However, there is no published research on the treatment of PTSD using acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in Vietnam. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treating PTSD using acupuncture combined with CBT in Thua Thien Hue province. Method and subject: This study was an interventional study conducted in two districts of Thua Thien Hue province. Thirty patients were diagnosed with PTSD using Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Participants were assessed on PTSD symptoms using PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL–5); depression, anxiety and stress status using DASS-21; and other health states before and after treatment. Result: The effectiveness rate of treatment was 83.3% by PCL–5 and 86.7% by DASS-21. The improvement of symptoms after 5 weeks of treatment was statistically significant (p &lt;0.05). Side effects were itch (5.0%), pain (4.3%); bleeding (1.3%); and others (0%). Conclusion: Treatment of PTSD using acupuncture and CBT has a high effectiveness rate on PCL - 5 scale and DASS21 scale. Improvement was similar when evaluated by the two scales. Acupuncture was safe and did not cause any significant side effects.

We investigated whether CPTSD predicted and moderated treatment outcomes of Prolonged Exposure (PE), intensified PE (iPE) and Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation followed by PE (STAIR + PE). We expected that CPTSD would predict worse treatment outcomes across treatments. Secondly, we expected that CPTSD would lead to better treatment effect in STAIR + PE compared to PE and iPE. We analyzed 149 patients with childhood-abuse related PTSD from a randomized clinical trial. CPTSD diagnosis and symptom severity were measured with the International Trauma Questionnaire. The main outcome was change in clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms. Assessments took place at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 16 (post-treatment) and at a 6-and 12-month follow-up. Analyses were based on an intention-to-treat sample using mixed effect models. More than half (54 %) of the patients met criteria for CPTSD at baseline. CPTSD was related to more severe PTSD symptoms and higher comorbidity at baseline. CPTSD neither predicted nor moderated treatment outcome. Inclusion was limited to patients with PTSD related to childhood abuse. Replication is needed in different samples. CPTSD is associated with more severe PTSD and with higher comorbidity. CPTSD did not predict treatment outcome and did not indicate differential treatment outcome of STAIR + PE compared to PE and iPE.",852

The 90 Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) were completed 1 week after trauma. The Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) was surveyed 3 months after discharge. PCL-C score of 38 was used as cutoff point. The older age and lower education significantly increased the PTSD incidence. SCL-90 score was positively correlated with PTSD symptom score. The psychoticism (P) (0.230) and neuroticism (N) (0.302) was positively correlated with PTSD symptom score in a linear relationship. Objective support, subjective support, exploitation degree, and social support were negatively associated with PTSD scores. Force symptoms, psychoticism, subjective support, introversion, and extroversion could explain 65.0% of degree of variation for PTSD with the estimated standard error of 4.758.

Meta-analyses providing individual treatment effect estimates focusing on CPTSD or samples at risk of complex traumatization (i.e., victims of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), war or torture, refugees, and veterans with PTSD) were eligible for inclusion. The effect sizes were classified according to Cohen as small, medium, or large. The ""A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews"" (AMSTAR) was applied to assess the quality of the meta-analyses, and power was assessed post-hoc.Twenty-four meta-analyses were suitable for inclusion. The efficacy of the interventions varied (g = -0.04 (CI -0.39; 0.48), controlled, to d = 2.73 (1.69; 3.76), uncontrolled). Overall, 16 effect estimates were large. On average, the quality of the meta-analyses was good (average AMSTAR total score 7.71 points (range 3-11). Considering quality assessments and power together, nine meta-analyses were evaluated as high quality.No meta-analysis for CPTSD was eligible and the number of individuals with complex traumatization was not directly assessed in the at-risk groups.For at-risk groups for complex traumatization, on average, good-quality empirical evidence exists. Given the limited research on CPTSD, future studies are needed to further investigate the efficacy of interventions.",854

All versions of this article have been corrected.] The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) 4-factor model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has demonstrated adequate fit in several confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) studies. Although several alternative measurement models have demonstrated better fit, there is no consensus yet on the best model, and newly proposed models lack sufficient construct validation. Notably, these studies have relied exclusively on questionnaire data, and thus their findings may be attributable to a method effect. This study examined the factor structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms using both questionnaire and interview data to determine the impact of assessment method on factor structure and construct validity of alternative model symptom clusters. Participants (N = 380) were veterans who completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers et al., 2013). Fit was similar across models. However, the seven-factor Hybrid model (Armour et al., 2015) fit best. Limited evidence of a method effect was observed. Results of construct validity analyses were mixed; some of the newly proposed symptom clusters demonstrated hypothesized differential associations with external correlates, but others did not. These findings suggest that results of previous DSM-5 PTSD CFAs supporting the Hybrid model are not attributable to a method effect. However, observed limited difference in model fit and mixed construct validity evidence raise concerns regarding the value of parsing DSM-5 symptom clusters. Constructs implied by the new factors in the more complex measurement models of PTSD require greater explication and construct validation.

However, there is a lack of prospective longitudinal studies to further illuminate the temporal relationship between self-efficacy and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Thus, an important unresolved research question is whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms affect the level of self-efficacy or vice versa or whether they mutually influence each other. The present prospective longitudinal study investigated the reciprocal relationship between general self-efficacy (GSE) and posttraumatic stress symptoms in 143 physical assault victims. We used an autoregressive cross-lagged model across four assessment waves: within 4 months after the assault (T1) and then 3 months (T2), 12 months (T3) and 8 years (T4) after the first assessment. Stress symptoms at T1 and T2 predicted subsequent self-efficacy, while self-efficacy at T1 and T2 was not related to subsequent stress symptoms. These relationships were reversed after T3; higher levels of self-efficacy at T3 predicted lower levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms at T4, while posttraumatic tress symptoms at T3 did not predict self-efficacy at T4. In conclusion, posttraumatic stress symptoms may have a deteriorating effect on self-efficacy in the early phase after physical assault, whereas self-efficacy may promote recovery from posttraumatic stress symptoms over the long term.",856

Little is known about within-treatment risk factors for dropout, limiting the ability during therapy to identify patients at risk for attrition. We examined measures assessing PTSD (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5), alcohol use (Substance Use Inventory; SUI), and patient satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire; CSQ-8) as potential within-treatment markers of dropout risk, administered to 110 veterans in a randomized clinical trial of integrated exposure therapy versus integrated coping skills therapy for comorbid PTSD + AUD. Hierarchical Cox proportional hazard models with dropout status as the endpoint assessed effects of PCL-5, SUI, and CSQ-8 on dropout risk, and whether effects differed by treatment modality. A significant interaction between treatment and changes in alcohol use was observed (HR = 2.86, p = .007), where between-session alcohol use was positively associated with dropout hazard rate for those receiving integrated exposure therapy (HR = 2.34, p = .004), but not coping skills therapy (HR = 0.73, p = .19). Specifically, an increase of one drink consumed per day in the interval since last assessment (typically 2–3 weeks) was associated with a 5-fold increase in dropout hazard rate. The findings provide preliminary evidence of detectable within-treatment markers of dropout during integrated treatment for PTSD + AUD. Study of within-treatment indicators proximal to dropout may help identify at-risk patients and inform timely strategies to boost retention.",857

The authors compared individually delivered mantram repetition therapy and another non-trauma-focused treatment for PTSD. Method: The study was a two-site, open-allocation, blinded-assessment randomized trial involving 173 veterans diagnosed with military-related PTSD from two Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics (January 2012 to March 2014). The mantram group (N=89) learned skills for silent mantram repetition, slowing thoughts, and one-pointed attention. The comparison group (N=84) received present-centered therapy, focusing on currently stressful events and problem-solving skills. Both treatments were delivered individually in eight weekly 1-hour sessions. The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and by self-report. Secondary outcome measures included insomnia, depression, anger, spiritual well-being, mindfulness, and quality of life. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using linear mixed models. Results: The mantram group had significantly greater improvements in CAPS score than the present-centered therapy group, both at the posttreatment assessment (between-group difference across time, −9.98, 95% CI=−3.63, −16.00; d=0.49) and at the 2-month follow-up (between-group difference, −9.34, 95% CI=−1.50, −17.18; d=0.46). Self-reported PTSD symptom severity was also lower in the mantram group compared with the present-centered therapy group at the posttreatment assessment, but there was no difference at the 2-month follow-up. Significantly more participants in the mantram group (59%) than in the present-centered therapy group (40%) who completed the 2-month follow-up no longer met criteria for PTSD (p<0.04). However, the percentage of participants in the mantram group (75%) compared with participants in the present-centered therapy group (61%) who experienced clinically meaningful changes (≥10-point improvements) in CAPS score did not differ significantly between groups. Reductions in insomnia were significantly greater for participants in the mantram group at both posttreatment assessment and 2-month follow-up. Conclusions: In a sample of veterans with PTSD, individually delivered mantram repetition therapy was generally more effective than present-centered therapy for reducing PTSD symptom severity and insomnia.",858

No validated Swedish instrument exists to measure postpartum PTSD according to DSM-5. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the City BiTS (City BiTS-Swe) and to examine the latent factor structure of postpartum PTSD. The secondary aim was to report the Swedish prevalence of PTSD following childbirth.A total of 619 women, who had given birth at five clinics in the past 6-16 weeks, completed an online version of City BiTS-Swe and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Additionally, sociodemographic and medical data were collected. A second questionnaire was answered by 110 women to examine reliability over time.The confirmatory factor analysis using the two-factor model gave best fit to the data. We found a high internal consistency (α = .89-.87) and good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.53-0.90). Divergent reliability with EPDS showed significant correlations with satisfying results for the subscale birth-related symptoms (r = .41).

Treatments for PTSD are limited to medications and in-session therapies. Assessing the way the heart responds to PTSD has shown promise in detecting and understanding the onset of symptoms. Objective This study aimed to extract statistical and mathematical approaches that researchers can use to analyze heart rate (HR) data to understand PTSD. Methods A scoping literature review was conducted to extract HR models. A total of 5 databases including Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline) OVID, Medline EBSCO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase) Ovid, and Google Scholar were searched. Non–English language studies, as well as studies that did not analyze human data, were excluded. A total of 54 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review. Results We identified 4 categories of models: descriptive time-independent output, descriptive and time-dependent output, predictive and time-independent output, and predictive and time-dependent output. Descriptive and time-independent output models include analysis of variance and first-order exponential; the descriptive time-dependent output model includes a classical time series analysis and mixed regression. Predictive time-independent output models include machine learning methods and analysis of the HR-based fluctuation-dissipation method. Finally, predictive time-dependent output models include the time-variant method and nonlinear dynamic modeling. Conclusions All of the identified modeling categories have relevance in PTSD, although the modeling selection is dependent on the specific goals of the study. Descriptive models are well-founded for the inference of PTSD. However, there is a need for additional studies in this area that explore a broader set of predictive models and other factors (eg, activity level) that have not been analyzed with descriptive models.",861

The Korean version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5-research version was used to confirm the presence of PTSD. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to evaluate the concurrent validity of the K-PCL-5 and K-PCL-5-S.It presented good internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.93) and test-retest reliability (r=0.90). The K-PCL-5 and K-PCL-5-S were highly correlated with the BDI-II, BAI, IES-R, STAI-S, and STAI-T.

However, research into personality-based internalizing and externalizing trauma responses has been limited to cross-sectional investigations of PTSD comorbidity. Personality typologies may present an opportunity to identify and selectively intervene with survivors at risk of posttraumatic disorder. Therefore this study examined whether personality prospectively influences the trajectory of disorder in a broader trauma-exposed sample.During hospitalization for a physical injury, 323 Australian adults completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire-Brief Form and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, with the latter readministered 3 and 12 months later. Latent profile analysis conducted on baseline personality scores identified subgroups of participants, while latent change modelling examined differences in disorder trajectories.Three classes (internalizing, externalizing, and normal personality) were identified. The internalizing class showed a high risk of developing all disorders. Unexpectedly, however, the normal personality class was not always at lowest risk of disorder. Rather, the externalizing class, while more likely than the normal personality class to develop substance use disorders, were less likely to develop PTSD and depression.Results suggest that personality is an important mechanism in influencing the development and form of psychopathology after trauma, with internalizing and externalizing subtypes identifiable in the early aftermath of injury. These findings suggest that early intervention using a personality-based transdiagnostic approach may be an effective method of predicting and ultimately preventing much of the burden of posttraumatic disorder.",863

Most of these studies were focused at the level of the disorder, examining the association between relationship dissatisfaction and having a diagnosis of PTSD or the total of PTSD symptoms endorsed. This disorder‐level approach is problematic for trauma theorists who posit symptom‐level mechanisms for these effects. In the present study, we examined the prospective, bidirectional associations between PTSD symptom clusters (e.g., reexperiencing) and relationship satisfaction using the data from 101 previously studied individuals who had had a recent motor vehicle accident. We also conducted exploratory analyses examining the prospective, bidirectional associations between individual PTSD symptoms and relationship satisfaction. Participants had completed the PTSD Checklist‐Civilian Version and the Relationship Assessment Scale at 4, 10, and 16 weeks after the MVA. We performed time‐lagged mixed‐effects regressions to examine the effect of lagged relationship satisfaction on PTSD clusters and symptoms, and vice versa. No cluster effects were significant after controlling for a false discovery rate. Relationship satisfaction predicted prospective decreases in reliving the trauma ( d = 0.42), emotional numbness ( d = 0.46), and irritability ( d = 0.49). These findings were consistent with the position that relationship satisfaction affects PTSD through symptom‐level mechanisms.",864

A comprehensive way to understand posttrauma psychopathology is through symptom trajectories. The study aimed to look at the developmental courses of PTSD and depression symptoms in the initial months posttrauma, and their interrelationship in children and adolescents by utilizing advanced group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM). Methods: Two-hundred-and-seventeen children and adolescents aged between eight and 17 exposed to single-event trauma were included in the study. Their PTSD and depression symptoms were measured at two weeks, two months and nine months, with further psychological variables measures at the two-week assessment. Results: The GBTM modeling yielded a three-group model for PTSD and a three-group model for depression. All participants’ PTSD symptoms reduced to non-clinical level by nine months: participants were observed to be resilient (42.4%) or to be able to recover within two months (35.6%), while 21.9% experienced high level PTSD symptoms but recovered in nine months time. The depression trajectories described a chronic non-recovery depression group (20.1%) and two mild symptom groups (45.9%, 34.0%). Further analysis showed high synchronicity between PTSS and depression groups but predictor analysis revealed disparate predictors. Perievent panic (CPP), appraisal (CPTCI), rumination and thought suppression at week two predicted slow recovery from PTSS, while pre-trauma wellbeing (CPAS), post-trauma anxiety (SCAS) and appraisal (CPTCI) predicted chronic depression. Conclusions: Posttrauma depression was more persisting than PTSD symptoms at nine months in the sampled population. Cognitive appraisal may be central to explaining PTSD-depression comorbidity.",865

While studies have shown clinically significant rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and trauma-related symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after COVID-19, little is known about how these symptoms evolve over time. Here, we report findings from a cohort study of 52 participants recruited from the greater New York City area following acute COVID-19 infection. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety-related symptoms, the Insomnia Severity Scale (ISS) for sleep-related symptoms, and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) for trauma-related symptoms both at baseline and at long-term (24-60 weeks post-infection) follow-up. We found a high degree of correlation between psychiatric symptom scales within participants. More participants met established cutoffs for clinically significant insomnia and post-traumatic stress at follow-up compared to baseline. Symptom scales for depression, insomnia, and PTSD were increased at long-term follow-up, with only increased PCL-C scores surviving correction for multiple comparisons (Z ​= ​2.92, W ​= ​434, p ​= ​0.004).

The present study sought to better codify the psychological presentation of pituitary adenoma patients through the lens of trauma and PTSD symptomatology. 128 patients who were successfully treated for pituitary adenoma were recruited from the Wexner School of Medicine at Ohio State University. Ranging in age from 23 to 74, the participants’ mental health functioning was assessed by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). The findings of this pilot study showed that the rate of traumatization (PTSD) for pituitary adenoma patients was significantly higher than that of the general population. With regard to comorbid trauma-related mental health impairment, our results demonstrated that when moderated by sex, pituitary adenoma patients had significantly higher psychopathology than the non-clinical population. Replicating the existing research, there was a significant positive correlation between trauma symptoms and trauma-related psychopathology in patients successfully treated for pituitary adenoma. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate the traumatic nature of this disease and the need for applied clinical intervention. Further research is needed to replicate these findings, in light of potential selection bias and sample size.",867

They reported significantly higher levels of perceived stress, worry, neurotic and immature defenses than participants with lower PTSD symptomatology. Perceived stress was significantly associated with PTSD symptomatology, both directly and indirectly through the mediation of worry. Furthermore, neurotic and immature defenses were significant moderators in some relationships of this model.Such data can provide useful indications to elaborate tailored interventions and specific prevention activities for PTSD.

The IES-R is a self-administered scale used to assess post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The current study aimed to examine the construct validity of the IES-R, based on the Rasch model, with COVID-19-related data, as well as to test the multilevel construct validity of the IES-R within and among countries during the pandemic crisis. Methods: A multi-country web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted utilizing the 22-item IES-R. A total of 1020 participants enrolled in our survey, of whom 999 were included in the analyses. Data were analyzed using Rasch modeling and multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA). Results: The Rasch modeling results of the IES-R demonstrated that the IES-R is a satisfactory instrument with the five-point Likert scale, asserting that its 22 items are significant contributors to assessing PTSD as a unidimensional construct covered by the items of the IES-R. The MCFA confirmed that the 22-item IES-R, with its three factors, including intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, demonstrates adequate construct validity at the within- and among-country levels. However, the results of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) model determined that the 16-item IES-R is better than the 22-item IES-R. Conclusion: The results suggested that the 22-item IES-R is a reliable screening instrument for measuring PTSD related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and can be utilized to provide timely psychological health support, when needed, based on the screening results.",869

This scoping review aimed to appraise the measurement properties of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that assess PTSD among North Korean defectors.Methods A systematic search was conducted using Research Information Sharing Service, ScienceON, PubMed, and Embase from their inception up to September 15, 2022. Each measurement properties of the included PROMs were evaluated using COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology. First, the methodological quality of each study on measurement properties was evaluated using the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. Second, the result of each single study on a measurement property was rated against the updated criteria for good measurement properties.Results After screening the articles, nine instruments from 40 studies were included. Among these instruments, Impact of Event ScaleRevised was the most frequently used (13 studies [38.1%]), followed by the Trauma Scale for North Korean Refugees, PTSD Checklist, and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. The theoretical basis of all PROMs was secure in terms of content validity. The most frequently tested characteristics in measurement properties for internal structure were internal consistency, criterion validity, and convergent validity. No study reported sufficient structural validity as confirmatory factor analysis results with a model fit.Conclusion There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of a specific PROM for use among North Korean defectors with PTSD.",870
https://openalex.org/W3034172576,10.1002/jts.22541,Change in Event Centrality and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms During Intensive Treatment,"Abstract Event centrality, defined as the extent to which a traumatic event becomes a core component of a person's identity (Berntsen &amp; Rubin, 2006), is both a correlate and predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, over and above event severity. These findings suggest that decreasing the perceived centrality of a traumatic event to one's identity might result in decreases in PTSD symptom severity. To date, few studies have examined how centrality is affected by PTSD treatment. The present study tested the hypotheses that change in centrality would be associated with both change in PTSD symptom severity and discharge PTSD symptom severity in an exposure‐based PTSD partial hospitalization program ( N = 132; 86.0% White; 85.2% female; M age = 36 years). At discharge (i.e., after approximately 6 weeks of treatment), both PTSD symptoms and centrality had significantly decreased, d s = .70 and .98, respectively, with large effect sizes. Decreases in Centrality of Events Scale (CES) scores at posttreatment, baseline CES scores, and baseline PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5) scores were associated with change (i.e., decrease) in PCL‐5 scores, p &lt; .001, as well as with posttreatment PCL‐5 scores, p &lt; .001. Decreases in CES scores over time, baseline CES scores, and baseline PCL‐5 scores explained 31% of the variance in PCL‐5 change and 34% of the variance in posttreatment PCL‐5 scores. The results indicate the potential importance of decreasing the centrality of a traumatic event in PTSD treatment and recovery.",871
https://openalex.org/W2205515994,10.1002/jclp.22439,A Cross‐Lagged Panel Study of Dissociation and Posttraumatic Stress in a Treatment‐Seeking Sample of Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse,"The current prospective study assessed the temporal relations between dissociation and posttraumatic stress (PTS) in a sample of treatment-seeking female survivors of childhood sexual abuse. PTS refers to symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the absence of a clinical diagnosis of PTSD.Initial assessment was on average 23 years after the onset of abuse (N = 405), and participants were followed-up after 6 months (N = 245) and 12 months (N = 119).Findings indicated that dissociative experiences and PTS were highly correlated within each wave of data collection. Cross-lagged panel analysis revealed that at each assessment period dissociative symptoms and PTS levels, respectively, were primarily explained by scores on the same variable at the previous assessment period. Although further reciprocal relations between dissociation and PTS were evident, these associations were relatively weak in magnitude.Current results provide important insights into the temporal relations between dissociative symptoms and PTS. The high correlations between dissociative experiences and PTS several years after trauma exposure have important clinical implications that may affect their treatment and trauma recovery.",872
https://openalex.org/W3093858068,10.1002/jts.22611,Temporal Stability of Self‐Reported Trauma Exposure on the Life Events Checklist for <i>DSM‐5</i>,"Abstract The Life Events Checklist for DSM‐5 (LEC‐5) is a comprehensive screening instrument used to detect exposure to a range of potentially traumatic events. Despite its widespread use, research assessing the psychometric properties of scores on the LEC‐5—and trauma exposure more broadly—is scarce. Using a large sample of undergraduate students ( N = 1,013), we sought to evaluate the reliability of trauma exposure reporting on the LEC‐5 across 8‐ ( N = 379) and 12‐week ( N = 343) intervals. Reliability estimates were examined for trauma exposure type (e.g., experiencing, witnessing), traumatic event type (e.g., sexual assault), and index trauma (i.e., “worst event”) reporting. Reliability was more stable for events that were directly experienced, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) = .62–64, than events that were witnessed, ICCs = .47–.52, or learned about, ICCs = .48–.53. Test–retest agreement was fair to good for reports of sexual assault, physical assault, transportation accidents, natural disasters, and other sexual experiences, κs = .49–.72, but only when individuals directly experienced these events. By contrast, across both assessment intervals, the agreement was attenuated, all κs &lt; .40, for events that individuals witnessed or learned about regardless of event type. For index events, only sexual assault and sudden accidental or violent deaths were consistently reported with a fair or better agreement, κs = .42–.64. These findings suggest that reliable trauma reporting varies largely based on the nature of the traumatic event, yielding important implications for the assessment of DSM‐5 Criterion A and posttraumatic stress disorder.",873

However, work has largely focused on male-dominant, high-risk occupation populations. We aimed to explore the relationship between posttraumatic stress (PTS) and alexithymia among 100 trauma-exposed female university students. Participants completed a Life Events Checklist, the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (PCL-5), and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Multiple regressions were run to examine whether alexithymia was associated with each of the PCL-5 subscales. The TAS-20 total scores were associated with total PTS scores, β = 0.47, t(99) = 5.22, p < 0.001. On a subscale level, Difficulty in Identifying Feelings (DIF) was positively associated (β = 0.50 to 0.41) with all PCL-5 subscales except for Avoidance. Our results align with research showing that for women, the DIF subscale is most strongly associated with PTS, in contrast with the literature on male samples, showing strongest associations with the Difficulties in Describing Feelings subscale, suggesting sex differences in associations between PTS and alexithymia. Our study supports the universality of the associations between alexithymia and PTS.",874

One could use the following psychodiagnostic methods: (1) a multi-level personal questionnaire “Adaptivity” (A. G. Maklakov, S. V. Chermyanin); (2) a method of differential diagnostics of depressive states (V. A. Zhmurov); (3) an assessment scale of stressful events (T. Holmes, R. Rage); (4) a personal scale of anxiety manifestations (J. Taylor in the adaptation of T. A. Nemchina); (4) the questionnaire “Methods of coping behavior” (R. Lazarus in the adaptation of T. L. Kryukova, E. V. Kuftyak, M. S. Zamyshlyaeva); (5) the test “Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder” (N. M. Cairn, J. M. Caddell, K. L. Taylor). However, descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were among mathematical and statistical methods of data processing. By means of the research, we proved that critical life events can act as a threat to the psychological health of a person in the case of a specific subjective response to this event in the form of expressed reactions indicating psychotrauma. Moreover, we determined (1) a decrease in adaptive potential (especially in such aspects as neuropsychiatric stability and communication abilities), (2) high anxiety, (3) pronounced depressive states, (4) low resistance to stress loads and maladaptation. Thus, we established that the adaptive potential of a person in a situation of a critical event is associated with such individual and personal characteristics as stress resistance, anxiety, and depressive states.",875
https://openalex.org/W2345794570,10.1007/s00127-016-1235-2,Can the dissociative PTSD subtype be identified across two distinct trauma samples meeting caseness for PTSD?,"For over a century, the occurrence of dissociative symptoms in connection to traumatic exposure has been acknowledged in the scientific literature. Recently, the importance of dissociation has also been recognized in the long-term traumatic response within the DSM-5 nomenclature. Several studies have confirmed the existence of the dissociative posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subtype. However, there is a lack of studies investigating latent profiles of PTSD solely in victims with PTSD. This study investigates the possible presence of PTSD subtypes using latent class analysis (LCA) across two distinct trauma samples meeting caseness for DSM-5 PTSD based on self-reports (N = 787). Moreover, we assessed if a number of risk factors resulted in an increased probability of membership in a dissociative compared with a non-dissociative PTSD class. The results of LCA revealed a two-class solution with two highly symptomatic classes: a dissociative class and a non-dissociative class across both samples. Increased emotion-focused coping increased the probability of individuals being grouped into the dissociative class across both samples. Social support reduced the probability of individuals being grouped into the dissociative class but only in the victims of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) suffering from whiplash. The results are discussed in light of their clinical implications and suggest that the dissociative subtype can be identified in victims of incest and victims of MVA suffering from whiplash meeting caseness for DSM-5 PTSD.",876

In this longitudinal survey study, we evaluated associations between mindfulness, baseline psychological symptoms, and 1-year psychological symptoms in long-term CA survivors. We collected demographic and CA characteristics at baseline. At both timepoints, we assessed posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) through the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) and depression and anxiety symptoms through the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). At follow-up, we assessed mindfulness through the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R). We used adjusted linear regression to predict 1-year PCL-5 and PHQ-4 scores, with particular consideration of the CAMS-R as a cross-sectional correlate of outcome. We included 129 CA survivors (mean age: 52 years, 52% male, 98% white). At 1-year follow-up, in adjusted models, CAMS-R (β: −0.35, p < 0.001) and baseline PCL-5 scores (β: 0.56, p < 0.001) were associated with 1-year PCL-5 scores. CAMS-R (β: −0.34, p < 0.001) and baseline PHQ-4 scores were associated with 1-year PHQ-4 scores (β: 0.37, p < 0.001). In conclusion, mindfulness was inversely associated with psychological symptoms in long-term CA survivors. Future studies should examine the longitudinal relationship of mindfulness and psychological symptoms after CA.",877

Traditional diagnostic categories such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are argued to be of limited value, and while the proposed ‘Developmental Trauma Disorder’ definition attempts to address this debate, associated assessment tools have yet to be developed. This review builds on a previous review of assessment measures, undertaken in 2005. Aim: To identify trauma assessment tools developed or evaluated since 2004 and determine which are developmentally appropriate for children or adolescents with histories of complex trauma. Method: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: A total of 35 papers were identified evaluating 29 measures assessing general functioning and mental health ( N = 10), PTSD ( N = 7) and trauma symptomatology outside, or in addition to, PTSD ( N = 11). Studies were evaluated on sample quality, trauma/adversity type, as well as demographic and psychometric data. Distinction was made between measures validated for children (0–12 years) and adolescents (12–18 years). Conclusion: Few instruments could be recommended for immediate use as many required further validation. The Assessment Checklist questionnaires, designed with a developmental and attachment focus, were the most promising tools.",878

Survivors of tragic accidents often experience psychological stress and develop post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), regardless of the diagnosis of PTSD. This study aimed to evaluate electroencephalographic changes according to PTSS in victims of a single traumatic event.This study enrolled 60 survivors of the Sewol ferry disaster that occurred in 2014 from Danwon High School and collected electroencephalographic data through 19 channels twice for each person in 2014 and 2015 (mean 451.88 [standard deviation 25.77] days of follow-up). PTSS was assessed using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the participants were divided into two groups according to the differences in PCL-C scores between 2014 and 2015. Electroencephalographic data were converted to three-dimensional data to perform low-resolution electrical tomographic analysis.Significant electroencephalographic changes over time were observed. The group of participants with worsened PCL-C score showed an increased change of delta slow waves in Brodmann areas 13 and 44, with the largest difference in the insula region, compared to those with improved PCL-C scores.Our findings suggests that the electrophysiological changes in the insula are associated with PTSS changes.",879

The study of PTSD is complicated by highly heterogeneous presentations and experiences of trauma between individuals. Capitalizing on the existence of the World Trade Center General Responder Cohort (WTC-GRC) of rescue, recovery and clean-up workers who responded during and in the aftermath of the World Trade Center (WTC) 9/11/2001 attacks, we studied genetic correlates of PTSD in a sample of 371 WTC responders, selected from the WTC-GRC utilizing stratified random sampling. This deeply phenotyped sample of WTC responders – ranging from no/low PTSD symptom levels to severe PTSD– provide a unique opportunity to study genetic risk factors for PTSD severity and chronicity following a single, shared, well-documented trauma, also incorporating measures of childhood and other lifetime traumas. We examined associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) –derived from a range of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of behavioral traits, psychiatric disorders, and brain volumetric phenotypes– with PTSD severity and chronicity among these 371 individuals. Our results demonstrate significant genetic regulation of lifetime PTSD severity, assessed with the lifetime version Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and chronicity, assessed with the past-month CAPS. PRS derived from GWAS of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and brain imaging phenotypes (amygdala and putamen volumes) were associated with several PTSD symptom dimensions. Interestingly, we found greater genetic contribution to PTSD among cases compared to our full sample. In addition, we tested for associations between exposures to traumatic stressors, including WTC-related exposures, childhood trauma, and other lifetime traumatic life events in our full sample. Together, polygenic risk and exposures to traumatic stress explained ~45% of variance in lifetime CAPS (R 2 =0.454), and ~48% of variance in past-month CAPS (R 2 =0.480) in the full sample. These participants represent a highly vulnerable population, with exposures to severe trauma during 9/11 and the following days and months. These novel identified associations between PTSD and PRS of behavioral traits and brain volume phenotypes, as well as replicated associations with PRS of other psychiatric disorders, may contribute to understanding the biological factors associated with risk for and chronicity of PTSD. In particular, the identification of neuroimaging phenotypes indicates that coupling of neuroimaging with genetic risk score calculations may predict PTSD outcomes.",880

The majority of participants (62.2%) indicated that they had experienced at least one index event that qualified for PTSD, even though a small proportion (5%) actually met the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Of those who reported an index event, 25 (8.04%) met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD while 286 (91.96%) did not. On average about one-third of participants who did not meet the criteria for PTSD endorsed PTSD symptoms whereas more than three quarters of those who met the full criteria did so. No demographic factors were associated with PTSD caseness, except number of traumatic events. These results are discussed in the context of the need to address traumatic events and PTSD among persons who undergo HIV testing.",881

The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which PTSD and depression co-occurred in Serbian general population at baseline and 1 year after the follow-up, as well as how this co-occurrence was associated with sociodemographic factors, personal distress, suicidality and quality of life. Subjects and methods The sample consisted of 159 subjects, who fulfilled the IES criteria for PTSD, and were taken from a larger sample of 640 participants, which was chosen by a random walk technique in five regions of the country affected by major trauma. The assessment was carried out by the following instruments: Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5 (MINI 5), Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (BSC-R), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life Scale (MANSA). The follow-up study was carried out 1 year after the baseline. Results In the initial phase, PTSD was found in 100 out of 159 participants (62.9%), while 81 (51%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MDD. Comorbidity of PTSD and depression was identified in 65 (40.9%) subjects of the sample. After 1 year, PTSD was found in 56 (35.2%) and MDD in 73 (45.9%) participants. Comorbidity of PTSD and depression in the follow-up phase was identified in 41 (25.8%) subjects of the sample. The subjects with comorbidity had significantly higher level of post-traumatic stress symptoms, general psychological distress as well as suicide risk and lower level of quality of life than participants with either condition alone. Conclusion PTSD–depression comorbidity is a common post-traumatic condition. Complex psychopathology, severity of symptoms and their consequences, both at individual and community levels, require attention to be paid to early diagnostics and treatment of affected persons.",882

This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) in reducing the symptoms of PTSD.: Five databases were searched from inception until November 2018 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy of IPT in patients with PTSD symptoms. The reference lists of included studies were also hand searched. A random effects model was used to estimate changes in a clinician-administered PTSD scale, or self-reported symptoms.: Of 509 screened abstracts, ten clinical trials (11 study arms) involving 755 patients with PTSD symptoms were included. Nine studies (10 study arms) were included in the meta-analysis. The overall standardized mean difference was -0.44 (CI: -0.69, -0.19), p = 0.0005. This represents a change in the clinically administrated PTSD Scale (CAPS) of approximately 12 points. IPT was not superior to other active controls, such as medication and non-IPT psychotherapies, but was significantly superior to passive controls, such as waiting list and educational pamphlets.: Most studies modified the IPT protocol and did not comprehensively assess clinician fidelity to the protocol. The included studies generally had small sample sizes and were of limited quality.: IPT may be an effective treatment for PTSD, but clinical trials with larger sample sizes and improved methodology are required to confirm effects.",883

However, there have been few studies on how comorbid PTSD may impact ED treatment outcomes.Participants were 2,809 patients from residential ED treatment facilities who were treated using the Unified Treatment Model (UTM). We investigated whether PTSD diagnosis at admission was associated with changes in Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) scores, binge eating, self-induced vomiting, and restriction, across three time points, as well as clinically significant improvement and treatment drop-out.Using latent growth models, with time modeled as a second-order polynomial, we found that EDE-Q scores and behavioral symptoms decreased from admission to discharge, but increased from discharge to 6-month follow-up. PTSD diagnosis was associated with higher baseline EDE-Q scores and restriction, and lower binge-eating frequency. PTSD diagnosis was not associated with symptom change over time, treatment dropout, or clinically significant change.Although PTSD diagnoses were associated with higher ED symptom levels at admission, PTSD was not associated with worse treatment outcomes, suggesting the UTM is a promising treatment for patients with and without PTSD. Future studies should investigate the impact of ED treatment on PTSD symptoms in order to determine the need for integrated treatments for these comorbid conditions.",884
https://openalex.org/W3094261770,10.2196/19162,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Neuroprogression in Women Following Sexual Assault: Protocol for a Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating Allostatic Load and Aging Process Acceleration,"Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent, chronic, and severe disorder related to traumatic events. Women are disproportionately affected by PTSD than men and are more at risk in the occurrence of sexual assault victimization. Estimates suggest that 50% of women develop PTSD following sexual assault and successful clinical management can be challenging. Growing evidence has implicated neural, immune, and endocrine alterations underpinning PTSD, but only few studies have assessed the evolution of acute PTSD in women. Objective This study aims to measure whether the onset of PTSD is associated with accelerated aging in women following sexual assault. We hypothesize that the increase of allostatic load caused by PTSD leads to neuroprogression. We will implement a randomized clinical trial to compare responses to treatment with either interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for PTSD (IPT-PTSD) or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline. Methods We will include women between 18 and 45 years of age, who experienced sexual assault from 1 to 6 months before the initial evaluation, and present with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of PTSD. Baseline evaluation will comprise clinical and psychometric assessments, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological testing, polysomnography, evaluation of immune and endocrine parameters, and genetic analyses. Age-matched female healthy controls will be included and subjected to the same evaluation. Patients will be randomized for treatment in 1 of the 2 arms of the study for 14 weeks; follow-up will continue until 1 year after inclusion via treatment as usual. The researchers will collect clinical and laboratory data during periodic clinical assessments up to 1-year follow-up. Results Data collection started in early 2016 and will be completed by the end of the first semester of 2020. Analyses will be performed soon afterward, followed by the elaboration of several articles. Articles will be submitted in early 2021. This research project has obtained a grant from the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP 2014/12559-5). Conclusions We expect to provide insight into the consequences of recent sexual assault exposure in women by investigating the degree of neuroprogression developing from an early stage of PTSD. We also expect to provide important evidence on the efficacy of a non-exposure psychotherapy (IPT-PTSD) to mitigate PTSD symptoms in recently sexually assaulted women. Further, we aim to obtain evidence on how treatment outcomes are associated with neuroprogression measures.

In total, 304 students from a school located in Lushan County were assessed by UCLA PTSD-RI at 1.5, 6, 12, 24 and 48 months after the earthquake. The children ages ranged from 9 to 17 years old at the time of the first assessment, and the sample included 140 males and 164 females. Four trajectories of PTSD symptoms were found, namely, resilience (53.8%), low symptoms (32.6%), recovery (7.0%), and chronic dysfunction (6.6%). Then, a logistic regression analysis that controlled for gender and grade showed that compared with the resilience group, children with an injury or probable acute stress disorder (ASD) were likely to be in the recovery group, children with probable ASD were more likely to be in the low-symptoms group, and children with a bad relationship with their father were more likely to be in the chronic group. The participants were selected by convenience principle. All children received an intervention after the earthquake. These findings suggest that increasing children's social support may relieve children's PTSD symptoms. We should consider both perceived threat and object exposure in future studies. The posttraumatic stress response was very high and was unstable during the first month after the earthquake, which suggests that psychological first aid is necessary in posttraumatic events.",886

Baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up assessments were made.Participants were randomized to receive 8 weekly 90-minute sessions of PE (n = 53), EMDR (n = 55), or WL (n = 47). Standard protocols were used, and treatment was not preceded by stabilizing psychotherapeutic interventions.Clinician-rated severity of PTSD symptoms, PTSD diagnosis, and full remission (on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) were primary outcomes. Self-reported PTSD symptoms and posttraumatic cognitions were secondary outcomes.Data were analyzed as intent to treat with linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations. Participants in the PE and EMDR conditions showed a greater reduction of PTSD symptoms than those in the WL condition. Between-group effect sizes were 0.78 (P < .001) in PE and 0.65 (P = .001) in EMDR. Participants in the PE condition (56.6%; odds ratio [OR], 3.41; P = .006) or the EMDR condition (60.0%; OR, 3.92; P < .001) were significantly more likely to achieve loss of diagnosis during treatment than those in the WL condition (27.7%). Participants in the PE condition (28.3%; OR, 5.79; P = .01), but not those in the EMDR condition (16.4%; OR, 2.87; P = .10), were more likely to gain full remission than those in the WL condition (6.4%). Treatment effects were maintained at the 6-month follow-up in PE and EMDR. Similar results were obtained regarding secondary outcomes. There were no differences in severe adverse events between conditions (2 in PE, 1 in EMDR, and 4 in WL). The PE therapy and EMDR therapy showed no difference in any of the outcomes and no difference in participant dropout (24.5% in PE and 20.0% in EMDR, P = .57).Standard PE and EMDR protocols are effective, safe, and feasible in patients with PTSD and severe psychotic disorders, including current symptoms. A priori exclusion of individuals with psychosis from evidence-based PTSD treatments may not be justifiable.isrctn.com Identifier: ISRCTN79584912.",887

Presently, there are no reliable and valid screening instruments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Filipino migrant workers, a population that numbers over 2.3 million worldwide. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in a sample of female Filipino migrant workers in Macao (SAR), China, in two studies. The first examined the reliability (internal and test-retest), convergent validity (with depression, anxiety, and rumination), and discriminant validity (with pain and social support) in a sample of 131 participants. The second study established criterion validity of the PCL-5 using the PTSD module of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), delivered by a female Filipino psychologist as the criterion, in a sample of 100 participants. Results indicated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.95) and moderate 10-day test-retest reliability (ρ = 0.58, p < .001). PCL-5 scores correlated strongly with scores on measures of depression (ρ = 0.71, p < .001), anxiety (ρ = 0.61, p < .001), and rumination (ρ = 0.68, p < .001), supporting convergent validity. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by a weaker association with scores on measures of pain (ρ = 0.33, p < .001) and social support (ρ = −0.11, p = .22). The diagnostic accuracy of the scale was good (AUC = 0.87). The optimal cutoff score of 25 optimized sensitivity (0.89) while maintaining adequate specificity (0.73), with a weighted Kappa of κ[1]) = 0.82. Our results demonstrated that the PCL-5 is a reliable and valid screening instrument for use among female Filipino migrant workers.",888

Objectives The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical manifestations of PTSD in the pediatric population. Methods This is a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out on children over the age of 7 and victims of a traumatic event that had occurred at least one month before. They were recruited from August 2020 to April 2021, in child psychiatry department. The clinical manifestations were evaluated using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale Child and Adolescent version for DSM 5 (CAPS CA5) in Tunisian dialect. The statistical processing of these data was carried out using SPSS 26 software. Results We recruited 101 children who had experienced a traumatic event which was in 35.6% physical assault, 47.5% sexual assault and in 16.8 % exposure to death. The mean age was 10.7 years at the onset of traumatic event and 11.74 years at the interview. We noted in our patients a female predominance at 64.4%. Diagnosis of PTSD according to the diagnostic criteria of the DSM5 was retained in 54.5% of cases. Intrusive symptoms were present in 81.2%, with 66.3% of involuntary, intrusive memories. Persistent avoidance of stimuli was noted in 80.2%. 71.3% of cases suffered from negative cognition and mood. We found in 66.3% marked alterations in trauma-related arousal and reactivity. Resulting in clinicialy significant distress in71.3%. Conclusions Recognizing PTSD symptoms is essential for diagnosis to initiate specialized care and reduce impairment at this critical age.

Previous researchers have identified subgroups of veterans with different response trajectories but have not investigated whether PTSD symptom clusters (based on a four‐factor model) have different patterns of response to treatment. The importance of this lies in the potential to increase treatment focus on less responsive symptoms. We investigated treatment outcomes by symptom cluster for 2,685 Australian veterans with PTSD. We used Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist scores obtained at treatment intake, posttreatment, and 3‐ and 9‐month follow‐ups to define change across symptom clusters. Repeated measures effect sizes indicated that arousal and numbing symptoms exhibited the largest changes between intake and posttreatment, d RM = −0.61 and d RM = −0.52, respectively, whereas avoidance and intrusion symptoms showed more modest reductions, d RM = −0.36 and d RM = −0.30, respectively. However, unlike the other symptom clusters, the intrusions cluster continued to show significant changes between posttreatment and 3‐month follow‐up, d RM = −0.21. Intrusion and arousal symptoms also showed continued changes between 3‐ and 9‐month follow‐ups although these effects were very small, d RM = −0.09. Growth curve model analyses produced consistent findings and indicated modest initial changes in intrusion symptoms that continued posttreatment. These findings may reflect the longer time required for emotional processing, relative to behavioral changes in avoidance, numbing, and arousal, during the program; they also reinforce the importance of prioritizing individual trauma‐focused therapy directly targeting intrusions as the core component of programmatic treatment.",890

We assessed the underlying factor structure of the Child PTSD Symptom Scale through exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in 570 survivors of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. The EFA suggests that the three-factor DSM-IV model fit these data best. The CFA suggests that while the DSM-IV model adequately fit these data, the four-factor King model fit them better. There was no evidence of differential item functioning by age or gender, and internal consistency of the scale was high. PTSD (overall or by factor) was not correlated with functional impairment. Inconsistent psychometric results across contexts and methodologies suggest that our current theoretical conceptualizations and empirical models of posttraumatic stress are lacking. Future studies must both document the instrument properties to assure internal validity and cross-study comparisons and, bolstered by increased psychometric data and analyses, rework theoretical models of PTSD with improved cross-cultural validity.",891

It was recently proposed that intrusions may be comprised of two distinct underlying processes: internally-cued intrusions (e.g., trauma-related memories), and externally-cued intrusions (e.g., reactivity to trauma-related cues in one's environment). This is the first study to examine the functional correlates of these two intrusion clusters.Participants included 7460 veterans discharged from 40 Veterans Affairs PTSD residential programs across the United States in fiscal years 2018 through 2020. Latent network modeling and structural equation modeling were used to assess the fit of an 8-factor model of PTSD symptoms, which were assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) PTSD symptoms at admission, and its association with symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety, and emotional and physical functioning.The 8-factor model, with separate intrusion factors, showed superior model fit to the DSM-5 4-factor, 5-factor dysphoric arousal, 6-factor anhedonia, and 7-factor hybrid models of PTSD. Internally-cued intrusions were uniquely associated with dysphoric arousal, decreased avoidance, and worse physical health functioning; whereas, externally-cued intrusions were uniquely associated with greater avoidance, anxious arousal, negative affect, increased generalized anxiety symptoms, and worse emotional functioning.Limitations include the cross-sectional design and use of self-report measures.Findings provide initial support for the clinical utility of a novel 8-factor model of PCL-5 PTSD symptoms, which distinguishes internally- and externally-cued intrusions. These separate intrusion symptom clusters may offer greater specificity and utility in informing the prognosis of and tailored interventions for PTSD.",892

Methods A questionnaire was used to assess symptoms. Design and Setting A longitudinal follow‐up study with responses collected from a self‐report booklet. Participants 179 respondents were present at 6 months post bushfires, with 103 and 87 participants at 2 and 7 years, respectively. Main Outcome Measures PTSD rates and its precipitating factors. Results The proportion of PTSD cases at times 1, 2 and 3 were 13.4% (24/179), 10.7% (11/103), and 4.8% (4/87), respectively. At 6 months, terrifying experience of fire reduced odds of developing PTSD (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.45; 95% CI 0.21–0.96) while relocation increased odds (OR: 2.93; 95% CI 1.06–8.08). At 2 years, relocation (OR: 6.81; 95% CI 1.07–43.41) was a positive predictor. At 7 years, personal loss from the fires (OR: 2.82; 95% CI 1.17–6.77) positively predicted PTSD. Conclusion PTSD rates declined over time. Relocation may be a proxy measure of high levels of emotional trauma. Those most traumatised probably decided to relocate, and hence, relocation should be considered a trigger for PTSD in the aftermath of bushfire.",893

Considering this, refugee populations merit continued research in the field of traumatic stress to better understand the psychological impact of these experiences. The symptom structure of PTSD underwent a major revision in the recent formulation in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and this reformulation has yet to be comprehensively investigated in the context of PTSD arising from traumatic events experienced by refugees. The current study assessed the construct validity of the DSM-5 PTSD structure in a refugee sample from a variety of cultural backgrounds alongside four alternate models commonly identified in western populations, namely the four-factor Dysphoria model, the five-factor Dysphoric Arousal model, and the six-factor Anhedonia and Externalising Behaviours models.A total of 246 refugees settled in Australia were assessed using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, to measure exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs), and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale, to assess symptoms of PTSD based on DSM-5 criteria. All measures were translated into Arabic, Farsi or Tamil using rigorous translation procedures, or provided in English.Findings from five confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) revealed that all models demonstrated acceptable model fit. However, an examination of relative fit revealed that the DSM-5 model provided the poorest fit overall for our sample. Instead, we found preliminary evidence in support of the six-factor Anhedonia model, comprising the symptom clusters of re-experiencing, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal, as the superior model for our data.Our findings offer preliminary support for the applicability of the Anhedonia model to a culturally diverse refugee sample, and contribute to a growing body of studies which indicate that the DSM-5 model may not best represent the symptom structure of PTSD found across non-western conflict-affected populations.",894

Patients completed a phase-based treatment: stabilization consisting of symptom management and establishing safety, followed by waiting for treatment (phase 1); individual TF-P in the form of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) or TF-CBT plus EMDR (phase 2). Our primary outcome was PTSD symptoms during phase 2 versus phase 1. Secondary outcomes included depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and a proxy CPTSD measure. Exploratory analysis compared outcomes between treatments. Adverse outcomes were recorded.Fifty-nine patients were included. Compared to receiving only phase 1, patients completing TF-P showed statistically significant reductions in PTSD [t(58) = -3.99, p < 0.001], depressive symptoms [t(58) = -4.41, p < 0.001], functional impairment [t(58) = -2.26, p = 0.028], and proxy scores for CPTSD [t(58) = 4.69, p < 0.001]. There were no significant differences in outcomes between different treatments offered during phase 2. Baseline depressive symptoms were associated with higher PTSD symptoms and functional impairment.This study suggests that TF-P effectively improves symptoms of CPTSD. However, prospective research with validated measurements is necessary to evaluate current and new treatments and identify personal markers of treatment effectiveness for CPTSD.",896

This study investigated the change trajectories of both depressive and PTS symptomatology as well as their associations over time, focusing on the effect of complex trauma. Data were obtained from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999–2007), a nationally representative study of children and adolescents who were referred to child protective services for alleged maltreatment. The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) scale measured depressive symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current trauma-related symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model. The participants' initial levels of depressive and PTS symptomatology were significantly and positively related; furthermore, any changes in these two outcomes were also correlated longitudinally. The initial assessment of PTS symptoms significantly contributed to the advancement of more severe depressive symptoms over time. No significant differences were found between youth who remained in the home and those removed from the home. However, violence exposure, sexual abuse, gender and age were significant predictors of level and rate of change in both PTS and depressive symptoms. PTS growth factors mediated the longitudinal relationship between witnessing severe violence and depressive symptoms. The findings suggest a complex developmental association between depressive and PTS symptomatology among CPS-involved youth that is rooted in early childhood experiences with complex trauma.",897

However, there are major gaps in our knowledge of trauma exposure in Africa and on the validity of instruments to assess potentially life-threatening trauma exposure.Objective: The Life Events Checklist for the DSM-5 (LEC-5) is a free, widely used questionnaire to assess traumatic events that can be associated with psychopathology. As part of a case-control study on risk factors for psychosis spectrum disorders, we used the LEC-5 to examine the frequency of traumatic events and to assess the questionnaire's factor structure in South Africa (N = 6,765).Method: The prevalence of traumatic events was measured by individual items on the LEC-5 across the study sample, by case-control status, and by sex. Cumulative trauma burden was calculated by grouping items into 0, 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 traumatic event types. Psychometric properties of the LEC-5 were assessed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.Results: More than 92% of the study sample reported experiencing ≥1 traumatic event; 38.7% reported experiencing ≥4 traumatic event types. The most endorsed item was physical assault (65.0%), followed by assault with a weapon (50.2%). Almost 94% of cases reported ≥1 traumatic event compared to 90.5% of controls (p < .001) and 94% of male participants reported ≥1 traumatic event compared to 89.5% of female participants (p < .001). Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 6-factor model. Confirmatory factor analyses of three models found that a 7-factor model based on the South African Stress and Health survey was the best fit (standardized root mean square residual of 0.024, root mean square error of approximation of 0.029, comparative fit index of 0.910).Conclusion: Participants reported very high exposure to traumatic events. The LEC-5 has good psychometric priorities and is adequate for capturing trauma exposure in South Africa.Trauma exposure was extremely prevalent in this South African sample, with less than 8% of participants reporting zero exposure to traumatic events.This was the first time the factor structure of the LEC-5 was assessed in South Africa.A confirmatory factor analysis using a 7-factor model based on a previous study of trauma exposure, the South African Stress and Health study (SASH), was the best fit for the LEC-5.",898

The aim of this preliminary study is to explore the possible associations between these two conditions among typically-developing college students. Methods Participants were 39 students, recruited from 2 Israeli universities. Twenty-four participants were psychology students, and 15 were business administration students. Participants completed self-report questionnaires tapping sociodemographic background, trauma exposure, PTSD (the PTSD Checklist-5, PCL-5), and autistic traits (the Autism Spectrum Quotient, AQ). Results Our preliminary findings revealed a positive association between symptoms of PTSD and autistic traits. More specifically, among those in the 3rd and 4th highest quartiles of AQ scores, 87.5% met the cut-off score for a probable PTSD diagnosis ( χ 2 (3) = 8.25, P &lt; 0.05). In addition, t-tests comparing the PTSD and non-PTSD groups showed significant differences in 3 out of 5 AQ sub-scales: social skill ( t (37) = –2.12; P &lt; 0.05), attention switching ( t (37) = −2.09; P &lt; 0.05) and communication ( t (37) = −2.80; P &lt; 0.01). Thus, higher AQ scores were reported by those in the PTSD group. Conclusions ASD may serve as a significant risk factor for post-traumatic symptomatology. The associations between these two conditions may be mediated by a variety of potential shared vulnerabilities, including increased rumination, dysregulated emotion and impaired social cognition. Further research is needed in order to explore these mechanisms, as well as to assess co-morbidity in clinical samples of both ASD and PTSD.

The aim of our study was to assess traumatic events in patients diagnosed with lymphoma and to determine which of these contribute to the development of PTSD. Two weeks after receiving a diagnosis of lymphoma, patients were referred for an assessment of peritraumatic distress (PDI) and peritraumatic dissociation (PDEQ). Three months after the diagnosis, we recorded the following parameters: the patients’ worst experiences, the presence of PTSD symptoms (PCL), and symptoms of anxiety using the HAD and of depression using the BDI-II The study recruited 129 patients (46 years, SD=17.3); 70 (54%) men, 87 (67.5%) with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 42 with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two weeks after the diagnosis, 49% of patients reported peritraumatic distress, and 20% peritraumatic dissociation, during being informed of the lymphoma diagnosis. Three months after the diagnosis, the severity of PTSD symptoms was evaluated. At this stage none of the patients suffered PTSD, but 29 (23%) individuals exhibited partial PTSD: 13.4% correlated it to receiving the lymphoma diagnosis, 8% to telling family members, and 1.6% to adverse effects. Peritraumatic distress and dissociation as a result of receiving a lymphoma diagnosis, as well as anxiety and a mucositis within the first 3 months post-diagnosis, were factors that were significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, accounting for 35.8% of PTSD’s variance. Clinicians should assess the impact of a number of stressors, which are risk factors for PTSD, starting from the time point of the initial lymphoma diagnosis.",900

We examined the frequency of positive screening results for probable PTSD in treatment-seeking Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel and Veterans when both DSM-5 and DSM-IV-TR symptom cluster criteria were applied. Methods: Previously collected data from 382 CAF personnel and Veterans were used to identify the frequency of positive screens using both sets of diagnostic criteria. Results: 71.2% ( n=272) of participants screened positively for probable PTSD using DSM-5 symptom cluster criteria, compared to 77.7% ( n=297) using DSM-IV-TR symptom cluster criteria. Percent agreement analyses found that negative percent agreement was 100.0%, positive percent agreement was 91.6%, and overall percent agreement was 93.5%. Discussion: The number of individuals who screened positively for probable PTSD using DSM-IV-TR criteria was higher than those who screened positively using DSM-5 criteria. The requirement of at least one avoidance symptom appears to have a noticeable impact on the frequency of positive screens for probable PTSD among treatment-seeking military personnel. This has important implications for pension adjudication and treatment entitlement.",901

This was to obtain access to an international instrument to identify symptoms of post-traumatic stress in children and adolescents according to the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5).A total of 591 young Swedish schoolchildren aged 13-17 years old were given the CATS together with the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC), and the Linköping Youth Life Experience Scale (LYLES-Y). A clinical group of 42 children who had experienced a potential trauma was also given the same questionnaires. Statistical analyses were carried out for the purpose of reliability, different kinds of validity, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) concerning the construct of the CATS.The CATS showed good internal consistency on all four subscales from α = 0.73-0.89 and moderate stability (intra class correlation [ICC] = 0.57-68). The four-factor model for PTSD indicated good fit, reliability, and convergent validity. The CATS correlated strongly with the PTSD subscale on the TSCC (r = 0.82) and there were significant differences between the nonclinical and clinical groups.The study shows that the Swedish translation of CATS has satisfactory psychometric properties, including acceptable sensitivity and specificity.

Identifying which CAs put individuals at greatest risk for these adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS) is important for targeting prevention interventions. Methods Data came from n = 999 patients ages 18–75 presenting to 29 U.S. emergency departments after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and followed for 3 months, the amount of time traditionally used to define chronic PTSD, in the Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study. Six CA types were self-reported at baseline: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect and bullying. Both dichotomous measures of ever experiencing each CA type and numeric measures of exposure frequency were included in the analysis. Risk ratios (RRs) of these CA measures as well as complex interactions among these measures were examined as predictors of APNS 3 months post-MVC. APNS was defined as meeting self-reported criteria for either PTSD based on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and/or MDE based on the PROMIS Depression Short-Form 8b. We controlled for pre-MVC lifetime histories of PTSD and MDE. We also examined mediating effects through peritraumatic symptoms assessed in the emergency department and PTSD and MDE assessed in 2-week and 8-week follow-up surveys. Analyses were carried out with robust Poisson regression models. Results Most participants (90.9%) reported at least rarely having experienced some CA. Ever experiencing each CA other than emotional neglect was univariably associated with 3-month APNS (RRs = 1.31–1.60). Each CA frequency was also univariably associated with 3-month APNS (RRs = 1.65–2.45). In multivariable models, joint associations of CAs with 3-month APNS were additive, with frequency of emotional abuse (RR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.43–2.87) and bullying (RR = 1.44; 95% CI = 0.99–2.10) being the strongest predictors. Control variable analyses found that these associations were largely explained by pre-MVC histories of PTSD and MDE. Conclusions Although individuals who experience frequent emotional abuse and bullying in childhood have a heightened risk of experiencing APNS after an adult MVC, these associations are largely mediated by prior histories of PTSD and MDE.",904

Methods We used longitudinal causal discovery in a veteran cohort for hypothesis-generation about PTSD and internalizing symptom drivers (n=240), followed by hypothesis-testing in two independent civilian cohorts with similar symptom assessments over time (n=79 and n=116). Results In the veteran cohort, causal discovery revealed PTSD symptoms drove internalizing symptoms, which subsequently impacted social functioning; all independent of problematic alcohol use. This replicated in treatment-seeking anxiety disorders (AD, n = 79) and substance abuse (SA, n = 116) samples with significantly better model fit for PTSD symptoms driving internalizing symptoms, versus internalizing symptoms driving PTSD symptoms (BIC change for AD sample = 175.1, p&lt;.001; BIC change for SA sample = 571.6, p&lt;.001). We also found better model fit with PTSD symptoms driving anxiety symptoms, versus anxiety symptoms driving PTSD symptoms (BIC change for AD sample = 71.8, p &lt; .001; BIC change for SA sample = 568.9, p &lt; .001). Posthoc analysis in the veteran sample revealed that hyperarousal and cognitive and affective disturbance bridged between other PTSD symptoms and internalizing symptoms. Conclusions Our findings suggest that internalizing symptoms that emerge in the context of PTSD are more likely to be driven by PTSD symptoms. These results highlight the need for a PTSD- and trauma-informed approach to treating internalizing symptoms, and provide preliminary evidence for cognition and mood disruption as a factor driving comorbidity.",905
https://openalex.org/W2524028943,10.1037/mil0000140,Psychometrics of Behavioral Health Screening Scales in Military Contexts,"A major task for military and civilian mental health practitioners is to screen United States service members/military personnel for an array of mental health problems (e.g., depression, alcohol abuse, suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) before further assessment leading to diagnosis of mental disorders. During the assessment of such mental health problems, screening scales should be not only reliable and valid, but also have clinical utility in the military context. Busy clinicians may not have enough time to determine which screening scales meet minimal psychometric standards and proven clinical utility with predeployment or postdeployment soldiers on active duty. A sample of screening scales was identified during a thorough review of the peer-reviewed psychometric literature, textbooks on psychometrics, and the American Psychological Association PsycINFO database. Selection criteria (e.g., acceptable psychometric properties, previously used in the military context) resulted in the identification of 7 core (first-order description) screening scales recommended in the assessment of mental health problems within the military context. Core scales were organized across 4 clinical domains: general mental health functioning (e.g., Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale [BASIS]), self-harm and risk-taking behaviors (e.g., Suicide Intent Scale [SIS]), assessment of PTSD (e.g., PTSD Checklist [PCL]) and Anger Reactions (e.g., Dimension of Anger Reaction Scale [DAR]), and assessment of substance abuse/dependence (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test -AUDIT). For each core scale, alternative scales were also selected using similar selection criteria. Implications of the study findings for the practice of military and civilian psychologists in the Department of Defense (DoD) are discussed.",906

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of PTSD in a large sample of SCA survivors. Prior history of psychological trauma and the effects of repeated trauma exposure on subsequent PTSD and symptom severity after SCA were also explored. A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 188 SCA survivors from the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association patient registry completed an online questionnaire that included measures of PTSD, trauma history, sociodemographics, general health, and cardiac history. Sixty-three (36.2%) SCA survivors in this sample scored above the clinical cutoff for PTSD. Female gender, worse general health, and younger age predicted PTSD symptoms after SCA. Additionally, 50.2% of SCA survivors (n = 95) reported a history of trauma exposure and 25.4% (n = 48) of the total sample endorsed a traumatic stress response to a historic trauma. Results indicated that a traumatic stress response to a historic trauma was a stronger predictor of PTSD after SCA (odds ratio = 4.77) than all other variables in the model. PTSD symptoms are present in over one-third of SCA survivors. While demographic or health history variables predicted PTSD after SCA, a history of traumatic stress response to a previous trauma emerged as the strongest predictor of these symptoms. Routine assessment and interdisciplinary management are discussed as potential ways to expedite survivors’ recovery and return to daily living.",907

To date, no FR study has validated these measures on a treatment-seeking sample.Confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to validate measures that assess these constructs (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) on a treatment-seeking sample of FRs ( N = 390).The seven-factor posttraumatic stress disorder hybrid configuration was the best fit. The best fitting factor model of the depression measure was a two-factor structure, cognitive-affective and somatic depression. Lastly, generalized anxiety was a unidimensional construct.Follow-up studies should validate these measures on each FR subtype.We position these findings within the FR literature, review clinical implications for providers, and offer recommendations for future research.",908

Such findings raise the possibility that individuals with high scores on catastrophizing might also be co-morbid for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of the present study was to examine the relation between level of catastrophizing and PTSD co-morbidity in individuals with whiplash injuries. The study sample consisted to 225 individuals (104 men, 121 women) who had sustained whiplash injuries in rear collision motor vehicle accidents. Participant age ranged from 18 to 61 years (mean = 36.9 years). The mean time since injury was 7.7 weeks with a range of 4 to 12 weeks. All participants were enrolled in a multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation program and completed pre- and post-treatment measures of pain severity (0 – 10 NRS), post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Events Scale; IES), and pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale; PCS). Consistent with previous research, there was a significant correlation between pain catastrophizing and post-traumatic stress symptoms (r = .62, P < .001). Scores on the IES were dichotomized as being above or below clinical threshold. Frequency analyses revealed that the probability of scoring above clinical threshold increased with level of catastrophizing. For individuals with PCS scores below 20, the prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms was 20%. For PCS scores between 20 and 25, the prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms rose to 55%; for individuals with PCS scores above 25, the prevalence of clinically significant PTSD was 88%. The results suggest that high scores on measures of pain catastrophizing in individuals with whiplash injuries should alert clinicians to the possibility of PTSD co-morbidity. Individuals who are co-morbid for PTSD might require intervention approaches that differ in important ways from those currently being used to decrease catastrophic thinking.",909

PTSS was measured with the PTSS scale. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were used as potential determinants of PTSS. Quality of life was measured with the EuroQol-5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L) EQ-Visual Analog Scale and the Satisfaction With Your Life Scale. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to study the presence of PTSS and different measures of health-related quality of life and quality of life as a function of study variables.The six-month prevalence of PTSS was 11.0%. PTSS was associated with age, marital status, number of chronic disorders and the presence of an anxiety disorder. PTSS was also associated with the EQ-5D-3L and the Satisfaction with Your Life Scale.PTSS is prevalent in patients consulting in primary care practices. Primary care physicians should be aware that PTSS is also associated with a decrease in quality of life, which can further negatively impact health status.",910

Pain at hospital discharge was measured with the Brief Pain Inventory. At 1-year follow-up, physical and mental health was assessed with the SF-12 and depressive and PTSD symptoms with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), respectively. Cut-off scores of 10 on the PHQ-9 and 44 on the PCL-C classified patients as having depression or PTSD.A total of 133 patients (62%) completed follow-up at 1 year. Responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly on baseline characteristics. Multivariable regression found that increased pain at discharge was significantly associated with depression (odds ratio=3.3; P<0.001) and PTSD (odds ratio=1.4; P=0.03) at 1 year, after controlling for age, education, injury severity score, and either depressive or PTSD symptoms at hospital discharge. Early postoperative pain was not a significant risk factor for long-term physical and mental health.Findings highlight the importance of early screening for uncontrolled postoperative pain to identify patients at high risk for poor psychological outcomes and who could benefit from more aggressive pain management. Results suggest early interventions are needed to address pain severity in patients with orthopedic trauma.",911

However, delirium has not been studied in relation to mental health outcomes after cerebrovascular events. This study aimed to examine the incidence of PTSD after nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and identify new predictors of poststroke PTSD symptoms. Methods: Clinical data were collected from 205 patients diagnosed with nontraumatic ICH. Demographics and hospital course data were examined. Univariate and multivariable correlational analyses were performed to determine predictors of PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms were assessed using PTSD checklist—civilian version (PCL-C) scores. Results: Diagnostic criteria for a positive PTSD screen (PCL-C score ≥44) were met by 13.7%, 20.2%, and 11.6% of nontraumatic patients with ICH at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. On univariate analysis, younger age, female sex, unemployed, and in-hospital delirium were correlated with higher PCL-C scores. In multivariable models, younger age, female sex, unemployed, in-hospital delirium, and a previous anxiety or depression diagnosis were associated with higher PCL-C scores at different follow-up times. Modified Rankin Scale scores were also positively correlated with PCL-C scores at each time point. Conclusions: Delirium, previous psychiatric history, younger age, female sex, and unemployment status were found to be associated with a greater degree of posthemorrhagic stroke PTSD symptoms. More significant PTSD symptoms were also correlated with greater functional impairment. A better understanding of patient susceptibility to PTSD symptoms may help providers coordinate earlier interventions.",912

This review aims to summarise and synthesize evidence from factor analytic and mixture modelling studies that have investigated the latent structure of the International Trauma Questionnaire. A systematic search of PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed databases was conducted to identify relevant articles. Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The latent structure of the ITQ was best represented by two models; a correlated six-factor model (Re-experiencing, Avoidance, Threat, Affect Dysregulation, Negative Self Concept, and Disturbed Relationships) and a two-factor second-order model (PTSD and Disturbances in Self-Organization). Mixture model studies consistently identified distinct classes representing those displaying PTSD and CPTSD symptoms. Numerous studies demonstrated support for the factorial and discriminant validity of PTSD and CPTSD when analysed in conjunction with other variables. Overall, support was found for the conceptual coherence of PTSD and CPTSD as empirically distinguishable disorders, as measured by the ITQ. The available evidence demonstrates that the ITQ is a valid measure of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD. Recommendations for future research are included.",913

Of the 195 parents who completed the 3-9-month assessments, 29 (14.8%) met posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) qualification on the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Multivariable analysis showed parents who met acute stress disorder (ASD) qualification (odds ratio [OR] 8.01; 95% CI 2.64-24.3), parents of children with Pediatric Overall Performance Category score of severe or coma at discharge (OR 5.21; 95% CI 1.65-16.4), parents who had concerns for their child's permanent injury (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.36-2.43), and parents who reported increased knowledge of child illness during admission (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.13-2.93) had increased odds of developing parental PTSD. Of the 175 parents (66%) who completed the 18-30-month assessments, 22 (12.5%) met PTSD qualification. Multivariable analysis showed parents who met ASD qualification (OR 4.19; 95% CI 1.12-15.7), parents who had a history of a family member or themselves being admitted to ICU (OR 6.51; 95% CI 1.43-29.6), and parents who had concerns of child's susceptibility to death post discharge (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.19-2.09) had increased odds of developing parental PTSD. At 18-30 months post discharge, parents who met the PTSD qualification were more likely to report a decrease in household income following discharge (OR 9.23; 95% CI 1.71-49.9).Parental PTSD remains a significant morbidity of PICU admission for a subgroup of parents greater than 18 months post admission.

This study aims to examine if emotion dysregulation mediates the relationship between early post-trauma sleep disturbance and subsequent PTSD symptom severity.Methods: Adult participants (n = 125) completed questionnaires regarding sleep disturbance (via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum; PSQI-A) and emotion dysregulation (via Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DERS) within 2 weeks after exposure to traumatic events.Results: PTSD symptom severity was assessed with PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) at 3-month follow-up. There were strong correlations between PSQI-A, DERS, and PCL-5 (r ranges between .38 and .45). Mediation analysis further revealed significant indirect effects of overall emotion regulation difficulties in the relationship between sleep disturbance at 2 weeks and PTSD symptom severity at 3 months (B = .372, SE = .136, 95% CI: [.128, .655]). Importantly, limited access to emotion regulation strategies emerged as the single, significant indirect effect in this relationship (B = .465, SE = .204, 95% CI [.127, .910]) while modelling DERS subscales as multiple parallel mediators.Conclusions: Early post-trauma sleep disturbance is associated with PTSD symptoms over months, and acute emotion dysregulation explains part of this association. Those with limited emotion regulation strategies are at particular risk of developing PTSD symptoms. Early interventions focusing on the appropriate strategies for emotion regulation may be crucial for trauma-exposed individuals.Early post-trauma sleep disturbance and emotion dysregulation associated with subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms.Emotion dysregulation mediates associations between acute sleep disturbance and later posttraumatic stress symptoms.Limited access to effective regulatory strategies was the single, significant contributor to this mediation link.",915

The psychological impact of HHT is not known. We conducted this cross sectional study to determine the prevalence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to HHT. Methods A survey tool comprising demographic and clinical information and two validated self-administered questionnaires, the PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), was distributed to individuals with HHT. Associations with clinical and demographic variables with depression and PTSD were evaluated in a logistic regression model. Results A total of 222 individuals responded to the survey. Of these, 185 completed either the BDI II or PCL-5 and were included in the analysis. Median age was 54 years and 142 (76.8%) were female. An existing diagnosis of depression, anxiety disorder and PTSD was present in 81 (43.8%), 59 (31.9%) and 16(8.6%) respondents, respectively. BDI-II scores > 13 indicating at least mild depressive symptoms were present in 142 (88.7%) patients and 52 (28.1%) patients had a positive screen for PTSD (PCL-5 score ≥ 38). On multivariable analysis, depression [OR 2.17 (95% CI 1.045–4.489), p = 0.038], anxiety disorder [OR 2.232 (95% CI 1.066–4.676), p = 0.033], and being unemployed [OR 2.234 (95% CI 1.46–4.714), p = 0.019) were associated with PTSD. Conclusion We report a high prevalence of depressive and PTSD symptoms in individuals with HHT. While selection bias may lead to overestimation of prevalence in this study, our results are concerning and clinicians should remain vigilant for signs of psychological distress and consider screening for these disorders.",916

Additionally, post-stroke symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (sPTSD) usually manifest as a type of anxiety disorder after a stroke. This study investigated the prevalence of sPTSD and the relationship between PTSS and rumination. Methods: The participants comprised 29 patients admitted to the Saitama Medical University International Medical Center within one week after experiencing a stroke. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised Japanese version (IES-R-J) and Leuven Adaptation of the Rumination on Sadness Scale Japanese version (LARSS-J) were employed for the evaluation of PTSS, sPTSD, and rumination. Results: The 29 patients (15 males, mean age: 63 ± 11 years) were classified as follows: 17 patients with cerebral infarction, 10 patients with cerebral hemorrhage, and 2 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The ratio of persons with sPTSD (IES-R-J total score &gt; 25) was 34% (10 patients). A significant positive correlation was found between PTSS and rumination (r = 0.460, p &lt; 0.05).

We examined PTSD symptoms in a cohort of U.S. Marines (N = 892) recruited for the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS). Marines deployed as one battalion infantry unit to Afghanistan in 2010 and were assessed pre-deployment and one, five, and eight months post-deployment. We employed latent transition analysis (LTA) to examine Marines' movement across PTSD symptom profiles, determined by latent class analysis (LCA). LCAs revealed a 3-class solution one month pre-deployment, a 4-class solution at five months post-deployment, and a 3-class solution at eight months post-deployment. LTA revealed notable movement between classes over time, which depended chiefly on pre-deployment symptom presentation. Marines who reported few pre-deployment symptoms either maintained these low levels or returned to low levels by eight months. Marines who reported a moderate number of symptoms at pre-deployment had variable outcomes; 50% had reductions by eight months, and those who reported numbing symptoms at five months post-deployment tended to report more symptoms at eight months. Marines who reported more PTSD symptoms prior to deployment retained more symptoms eight months post-deployment. Combat exposure and post-deployment stressor exposure predicted profile transitions. Examining transitions between latent class membership over time revealed prognostic information about Marines' eight-month PTSD outcomes. The extent of pre-deployment PTSD symptoms was particularly informative of likely PTSD outcomes.",918

In addition, we estimated the comorbidity with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder according to these four diagnostic manuals.Method: A web-based survey (n = 6,180) was conducted from November 2016 to March 2017. Participants completed the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and other standardized measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety.Results: The prevalence of PTSD caseness according to ICD-11 was significantly lower as compared to DSM-IV, DSM-5, and ICD-10. Cohen’s kappa between DSM-5 and ICD-11 was 0.79, indicating substantial agreement. Comorbidity with depression was significantly higher in unique DSM-5 cases than in unique ICD-11 cases. Unique DSM-5 PTSD cases were significantly stronger functionally impaired than unique ICD-11 PTSD cases.Conclusions: Although requiring fewer items, the ICD-11 showed substantial agreement with DSM-5 regarding PTSD caseness. The lower comorbidity rates in unique cases may support the concept of the ICD-11 which intends to reduce comorbidity by identifying the core elements of PTSD.",919

The study examined the direct pathway to PTG and PTSS through previously identified predictors including core belief disruption, event centrality, and rumination, with the addition of self-disclosure as a predictor variable.Participants (N = 231) who had experienced a traumatic event were recruited through online forums and completed an anonymous survey. Factor analysis revealed 2 distinct types of disclosure: helpful and unhelpful. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regressions.The findings supported a combination of event centrality, core-belief disruption, deliberate rumination, and helpful disclosure significantly predicting PTG, with event centrality and unhelpful disclosure being significant predictors of PTSS.The current findings provide support for the direct pathway described in the model of PTG, and that PTSS and PTG share some similar predictors, as well as distinct differences. These findings have the potential to assist clinicians and researchers in recognizing factors that are likely promote the development of PTG.

In patients who have experienced more than one traumatic event, severity may depend on the exact definition of the index trauma. Defining the index trauma as the worst single incident may result in PTSD severity scores that differ from what would be seen if the index trauma included multiple events. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the definition of the index trauma on PTSD baseline severity scores and treatment outcome. Method: A planned secondary analysis was performed on data from a subset (N = 58) of patients enrolled in a trial evaluating the efficacy of a 12 week residential dialectical behavioural therapy programme for PTSD related to childhood abuse (DBT-PTSD). Assessments of the severity of PTSD were conducted at admission, at the end of the 12 week treatment period, and at 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment, using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. The index trauma was defined with respect to both the worst single incident and up to three qualitatively distinct traumatic events. Results: When the index trauma included multiple traumas, PTSD severity scores were significantly higher and improvements from pre- to post-treatment were significantly lower than when the index trauma was defined as the worst single incident. Conclusions: In patients with PTSD who have experienced multiple traumas, defining the index trauma as the worst single incident may miss some aspects of clinically relevant symptomatology, thereby leading to a possibly biased interpretation of treatment effects. In DBT-PTSD, treatment effects were lower when the index trauma included multiple traumatic events. More research is needed to determine the impact of the various index trauma definitions on the evaluation of other trauma-focused treatments.Antecedentes: Para diagnosticar un trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) se requiere la identificación de uno o más eventos traumáticos. La designación del trauma índice sirve para evaluar la severidad del TEPT. En pacientes que han experimentado más de un evento traumático, la severidad podría depender de la definición exacta que se le otorgue al trauma índice. Definir el trauma índice como el peor incidente podría resultar en puntajes de severidad diferentes a los obtenidos si el trauma índice incluyera o comprendiera eventos múltiples.Objetivo: Este estudio investiga el impacto de la definición del trauma índice sobre los puntajes de severidad basal de TEPT y los resultados del tratamiento.Método: Se realizó un análisis secundario planificado sobre los datos de una muestra (N = 58) de pacientes reclutados para un ensayo que evaluaba la eficacia de un programa residencial DBT-TEPT de 12 semanas para TEPT relacionado a abuso infantil. Se evaluó la severidad del TEPT usando la escala de TEPT Administrada por el clínico al inicio, al final del periodo de 12 semanas de tratamiento, y a las 6 y 12 semanas posteriores al tratamiento. El trauma índice se definió tanto para el peor incidente como para hasta tres eventos cualitativamente distintos.Resultados: Cuando el trauma índice incluye múltiples traumas, los puntajes de severidad de TEPT fueron significativamente más altos y la mejoría posterior al tratamiento fue significativamente más baja comparado a cuando el trauma índice era definido solamente con el peor incidente.Conclusiones: En pacientes con TEPT que han experimentado múltiples traumas, definir el trauma índice con el peor incidente puede pasar por alto algunos aspectos de la sintomatología clínicamente relevantes, conduciendo a posibles interpretaciones sesgadas de los efectos del tratamiento. En DBT-TEPT, los efectos del tratamiento fueron menores cuando el trauma índice incluyó eventos traumáticos múltiples. Se requiere mayor investigación para determinar el impacto de las diversas definiciones de trauma índice sobre la evaluación de resultados de otros tratamientos focalizados en trauma.背景：诊断创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）需要确定一项或多项创伤事件，称为指标创伤，作为评估PTSD严重程度的基础。 在经历多于一次创伤性事件的患者中，严重程度可能取决于指标创伤的确切定义。 将指数创伤定义为最差的单一事件可能导致PTSD严重程度分数与如果让指数创伤包括多个事件之后的 PTSD 分数不同。目的：本研究调查指数创伤的定义对PTSD基线严重度评分和治疗结果的影响。方法：对纳入试验的患者（N = 58）的数据按计划进行二次分析，数据来自评估一个12周住院DBT-PTSD计划对与儿童期虐待有关的PTSD疗效的项目。 PTSD严重程度的评估在入院时，12周治疗结束时和治疗后6周和12周时使用临床医生管理的PTSD量表进行。 指数创伤被定义为最严重的单一事件和多达三个性质不同的创伤性事件。结果：当指数创伤包括多次创伤时，PTSD严重度评分显著较高，治疗前后的改善效果显著低于当指数创伤被定义为最差的单一事件。结论：PTSD患者经历过多次创伤，定义指数创伤是最差的单一事件可能会错过临床相关症状的某些方面，从而导致对治疗效果可能存在偏倚的解释。 在DBT-PTSD中，当指数损伤包括多次创伤事件时，治疗效果较低。 需要更多的研究来确定各种指数创伤定义对其他创伤治疗评估的影响。.",921

We hypothesized that pretrauma characteristics of the person could predict posttrauma severity and recovery.Sex, age, body mass index, income, education level, employment status, pre-existing chronic pain or psychopathology, and recent life stressors were collected from adults with acute musculoskeletal trauma through self-report. In study 1 (cross-sectional, n=128), pain severity was captured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), distress through the Traumatic Injuries Distress Scale (TIDS) and depression through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). In study 2 (longitudinal, n=112) recovery was predicted using scores on the Satisfaction and Recovery Index (SRI) and differences within and between classes were compared with identify pre-existing predictors of posttrauma recovery.Through bivariate, linear and nonlinear, and regression analyses, 8.4% (BPI) to 42.9% (PHQ-9) of variance in acute-stage predictors of chronicity was explainable through variables knowable before injury. In study 2 (longitudinal), latent growth curve analysis identified 3 meaningful SRI trajectories over 12 months. Trajectory 1 (start satisfied, stay satisfied [51%]) was identifiable by lower TIDS, BPI, and PHQ-9 scores, higher household income and less likely psychiatric comorbidity. The other 2 trajectories (start dissatisfied, stay dissatisfied [29%] versus start dissatisfied, become satisfied [20%]) were similar across most variables at baseline save for the ""become satisfied"" group being mean 10 years older and entering the study with a worse (lower) SRI score.The results indicate that 3 commonly reported predictors of chronic musculoskeletal pain (BPI, TIDS, PHQ-9) could be predicted by variables not related to the injurious event itself. The 3-trajectory recovery model mirrors other prior research in the field, though 2 trajectories look very similar at baseline despite very different 12-month outcomes. Researchers are encouraged to design studies that integrate, rather than exclude, the pre-existing variables described here.",922

This study aimed to assess Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) among patients who experienced mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and their household contacts. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between May 2020 and November 2020, in Ismailia and Suez governorates. A convenient sampling method was used. The sample size was calculated according to the prevalence of PTSD in COVID-19 patients to be 200 adult participants from both sexes, 100 patients with history of recent COVID-19 infection (up to 2 months after recovery) and their close family. COVID-19 was confirmed by a nasal swab sample tested by PCR in addition to suggestive symptoms and/or positive computed tomography lung findings. Data was collected by using the Arabic version of the Post-Traumatic Stress disorder checklist 5 (PCL5-PTSD) and the Arabic version of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The questionnaire was collected through interviews at the Endemic and Infectious diseases and Family medicine outpatient clinics. Of the 200 studied participants, evidence of PTSD was found in 112 (56%) participants; all COVID-19 cases and 12 of their close-contact relatives. Impaired HRQoL was evident in 107 (53.5%) participants; all the COVID-19 cases and 7 contacts. The mean values total scores of the PTSD and HRQoL and its domains were significantly higher among cases compared to their contacts. The most frequently impaired domain was social (55%), psychological (54.5%), impairment (53.5%) followed by physical (48.5%) and the least was health perception (33.5%). The mean values of PTSD, HRQoL and their domains were significantly higher among participants who recalled respiratory symptoms and who had comorbid illness. The odds ratio of PTSD and HRQoL was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.2-0.36) and 0.3 (95% CI: 0.23-0.39) in participants who had more than a case of COVID-19 within their families. All the studied COVID-19 participants showed PTSD and impaired HRQoL, compared to 12% and 7% of their contacts, respectively. Past COVID-19 was associated with impairment of all domains of HRQoL and the most affected were the physical, psychological and impairment domains.",923

Whereas treatments have been designed that target PTSD+SUD with some success, these treatments do not benefit all. Data-driven approaches that combine person- and variable-centered methods, such as parallel process latent class growth analysis (PP-LCGA) can be used to identify response-to-treatment trajectories across both PTSD symptoms and substance use. The current study employed PP-LCGA separately in two randomized clinical trials (study 1 n = 81, Mean age = 40.4 years, SD = 10.7; study 2 n = 59, Mean age = 44.7 years, SD = 9.4) to examine PTSD symptom response and percentage of days using substances across treatment trials comparing Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and SUD using Prolonged Exposure and Relapse Prevention. Results revealed four PTSD+SUD profiles for study one and three PTSD+SUD profiles for study two. For PTSD symptoms, response trajectories could be broadly classified into treatment responders and non-responders across both studies. For substance use, response trajectories could be broadly classified into declining, moderately stable, and abstaining profiles. When considering PTSD symptoms and substance use trajectories together, profiles emerged that would have been missed had these treatment outcomes been considered separately.",924

Using partial crowd-translations, two professional translations and the official Dutch translation of the DSM-5, each senior expert aggregated one independent translation. Consensus was reached plenary. After back-translation, comparison with the original CAPS-5 and field testing, a last round with the senior experts resulted in the final version. After implementation clinicians conducted CAPS-5 interviews with 669 trauma-exposed individuals referred for specialized diagnostic assessment. Reliability of the Dutch CAPS-5 was investigated through internal consistency and interrater reliability analyses, and construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).Results: CAPS-5 total severity score showed high internal consistency (α = .90) and interrater reliability (ICC = .98, 95% CI: .94–.99). CAPS-5 diagnosis showed modest interrater reliability (kappa = .59, 95% CI: .20–.98). CFA with alternative PTSD models revealed adequate support for the DSM-5 four-factor model, but a six-factor (Anhedonia) model fit the data best.Conclusions: The Dutch CAPS-5 is a carefully translated instrument with adequate psychometric properties. Current results add to the growing support for more refined (six and seven) factor models for DSM-5 PTSD indicating that the validity and clinical implications of these models should be objective of further research.",925

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans- and queer adults (LGBTQ+) are at a heightened risk of exposure to traumatic events, and minority stressors including harassment, discrimination, rejection by family, and isolation.To examine the factor structure of the international trauma questionnaire (ITQ), a self-report measure of PTSD and CPTSD, and the associations of cumulative lifetime trauma exposure assessed via the life events checklist and minority stress assessed via the daily heterosexist experiences scale, with CPTSD (three PTSD symptom clusters, three clusters reflecting disturbances in self-organization [DSO]) among LGBTQ + adults.Participants comprised 225 LGBTQ + adults (including 74 transgender and gender diverse individuals; age range: 18-60 years; M/SD = 31.35/9.48) residing in Spain.Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that both a first-order six-factor model and a hierarchical two-factor model, comprising PTSD and DSO as second-order factors, fit the data best. Cumulative traumatic events score was associated with PTSD, and cumulative minority stress was associated with PTSD and DSO. Among the minority stress subscales, harassment based on gender expression was positively associated with all symptom clusters of PTSD and DSO.This is the first study to examine the role of minority stressors alongside exposure to psychological traumas in ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD and emphasizes the inclusion of minority stressors in trauma-related assessments.

A screening battery assessing PTSD symptoms (PCL-C), alcohol use (AUDIT), drug abuse (DAST), and psychological measures was administered to 562 Latino immigrants recruited in clinics. We used logistical regression analyses to evaluate the relationship between PTSD symptoms and AUD/SUD. Prevalence of elevated PTSD symptoms was high (53.7 % in Boston, 47.9 % in Madrid and, 43.8 % in Barcelona). Screening positive for psychological measures was significantly correlated to screening positive on the PCL-C (p < 0.001). Significant gender differences in risk of AUD/SUD were moderated by PTSD symptoms. Presence of any PTSD symptoms predicted problems with benzodiazepine misuse. Given the high rates of co-morbidity between PTSD symptoms and AUD/SUD, we recommend early interventions for dual pathology for Latino immigrants with trauma history.",927

Service members with extremity injuries (EIs) or traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be at particular risk for long-term deficits in mental and physical health functioning compared with service members with other injuries. Methods The present study combined medical records with patient reports of mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for 2,537 service members injured in overseas contingency operations who participated in the Wounded Warrior Recovery Project. Combined parallel-serial mediation models were tested to examine the pathways through which injury is related to mental and physical health conditions, and long-term HRQOL. Results Results revealed that injury was indirectly related to long-term HRQOL via its associations with physical health complications and mental health symptoms. Relative to TBI, EI was associated with a higher likelihood for a postinjury diagnosis for a musculoskeletal condition, which were related to lower levels of later posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and higher levels of physical and mental HRQOL. Similarly, EI was related to a lower likelihood for a postinjury PTSD diagnosis, and lower levels of subsequent PTSD symptoms, and therefore higher physical and mental HRQOL relative to those with TBI. Despite this, the prevalence of probable PTSD among those with EI was high (35%). Implications for intervention, rehabilitation, and future research are discussed.",928

In addition, Regression statistical analysis was performed for data analysis and results indicated a moderate prevalence of PSTD symptoms in females as compared to Male. Overall proneness towards PTSD is calculated as 45.6% among the respondents (R-square = 0.456). Thorough consideration of ethical parameters is enforced by several procedures comprising informed consent, right to withdraw, disposal of data, and confidentiality. The current study would act as a basis for future researches to reduce the prevalence of psychological issues that patients face during this period of pandemic and would help in catering suitable interventions for the patients.&#x0D;",929
https://openalex.org/W3203610595,10.3390/jcm10194522,Personalization of Treatment for Patients with Childhood-Abuse-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Background: Differences in effectiveness among treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are typically small. Given the variation between patients in treatment response, personalization offers a new way to improve treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of psychotherapy outcome in PTSD and to combine these into a personalized advantage index (PAI). Methods: We used data from a recent randomized controlled trial comparing prolonged exposure (PE; n = 48), intensified PE (iPE; n = 51), and skills training (STAIR), followed by PE (n = 50) in 149 patients with childhood-abuse-related PTSD (CA-PTSD). Outcome measures were clinician-assessed and self-reported PTSD symptoms. Predictors were identified in the exposure therapies (PE and iPE) and STAIR+PE separately using random forests and subsequent bootstrap procedures. Next, these predictors were used to calculate PAI and to retrospectively determine optimal and suboptimal treatment in a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Results: More depressive symptoms, less social support, more axis-1 diagnoses, and higher severity of childhood sexual abuse were predictors of worse treatment outcomes in PE and iPE. More emotion regulation difficulties, lower general health status, and higher baseline PTSD symptoms were predictors of worse treatment outcomes in STAIR+PE. Randomization to optimal treatment based on these predictors resulted in more improvement than suboptimal treatment in clinician assessed (Cohens’ d = 0.55) and self-reported PTSD symptoms (Cohens’ d = 0.47). Conclusion: Personalization based on PAI is a promising tool to improve therapy outcomes in patients with CA-PTSD. Further studies are needed to replicate findings in prospective studies.",930

Three hundred thirty-three children (154 males, 179 females) were assessed for acute stress disorder (ASD) and depressive symptoms at 2 weeks (T1), and their PTSD and depressive symptoms were recorded at 1.5 (T2), 6 (T3), 12 (T4) and 24 (T5) months after the earthquake. The results showed that ASD predicted PTSD and depressive symptoms from T1 to T2, and PTSD symptoms predicted depressive symptoms from T2 to T5, but not vice versa. Depressive symptoms predicted avoidance from T1 to T5; in turn, avoidance predicted depressive symptoms from T3 to T5. Hyperarousal and intrusive symptoms had an effect on depressive symptoms between T1 and T2, and depressive symptoms predicted hyperarousal and intrusion from T2 to T3; after 12 months they did not significantly predict each other. The results suggest that PTSD symptoms generally precede depressive symptoms, and that hyperarousal and intrusive symptoms are major symptoms of PTSD soon after trauma events, while avoidance symptoms are major symptoms of PTSD late after trauma events. The relationship between PTSD and depressive symptoms mostly fits the interactive model.",931

Challenges related to differential diagnosis and measurement of PTSD in ASD are considered and illustrated via a case example. The chapter concludes with an overview of evidence-based treatments for PTSD in people without ASD, and their potential applications for those with ASD. Overall, the limited research on PTSD in ASD thus far points to increased rates of adversity and related psychopathology, but few evidence-based approaches to assessment or treatment of PTSD and other trauma-related symptoms in this population. Future investigations should consider not only PTSD in ASD but also a broader range of potential sources and symptoms of trauma in ASD and work quickly to identify empirically supported assessments and treatments.",932

This study aimed to shed light on the mental health status of patients with rheumatic disease (RD) during the massive outbreak of COVID-19 in China, especially the prevalence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared with healthy individuals. Methods A total of 486 patients with RD and 486 age-matched and sex-matched healthy individuals were recruited into the study. For each participant, we collected demographic and clinical characteristics data. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and four items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to investigate the prevalence and severity of PTSD and sleep quality, respectively. Results Compared with healthy control subjects (n=486), patients with RD (n=486) had a higher prevalence of PTSD (12.1% vs 4.1%; p&lt;0.001). Higher total scores on the PCL-5 and on all four items from the PSQI (p≤0.001) were also observed. Female, old age, poor sleep quality, long duration of RD, poor subjective evaluation of the disease and pessimistic subjective perception of the epidemic were identified as risk factors of PTSD in patients with RD during the COVID-19 epidemic. Conclusion During the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with RD presented a higher prevalence and severity of PTSD and showed more sleep disturbances.

Yet, authors have argued that early trauma could lead to alterations in development that go far beyond the primary symptoms of PTSD and have proposed Complex PTSD as an alternative diagnosis encompassing difficulties in affect regulation, relationships and self-concept.Objective: To delineate profiles in child victims of sexual abuse and explore whether profiles are associated with treatment response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.Method: Latent class analysis was used to identify symptom profiles at baseline assessment of 384 children ages 6 to 14, recruited in a Child Advocacy Centre following disclosure of sexual abuse. Dimensions of Complex PTSD diagnosis as proposed by the ICD-11 were derived from self-report questionnaires.Results: Latent class analysis identified a best fitting model of three classes: Classic PTSD regrouping 51% of children, Complex PTSD describing 23% of children, and Resilient describing 25% of children. Trauma-focused therapy was associated with a significant reduction of dissociation, internalizing, and externalizing problems for children of all three classes. Trauma-focused therapy was also linked to a significant reduction of PTSD symptoms with larger effect size (d = .90; 95%CI: 0.63–1.16) for children classified in the Complex PTSD class.Conclusion: These findings highlight the utility of a person-oriented approach to enhance our understanding of the diversity of profiles in child victims.

Consequently, sound assessment of PTSD in this underserved and understudied population is necessary to develop and accurately answer research questions about etiology and intervention efficacy. However, the item-level psychometric properties of one of the most commonly used assessment tools, the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), has yet to be examined among Black Americans. To address this gap, we used item response theory (IRT) to assess item difficulty and discrimination in a sample of Black American adults (n = 307). We employed a graded response model with all 20 items of the PCL-5 loading on to a latent PTSD factor. At clinically significant levels of PTSD, the most discriminating items were flashbacks, inability to experience positive emotions, and nightmares and the least discriminating items were cued emotional distress, diminished interest, and hypervigilance. These results emphasize the importance of flashbacks, inability to experience positive emotions, and nightmares and deemphasize the importance of hypervigilance and sleep difficulties when assessing for clinically significant symptoms of PTSD in Black Americans. Treatment implications include a nuanced approach towards hypervigilance.",937

Group differences in baseline characteristics as well as pre-post pandemic symptom levels were examined, and participant characteristics were assessed as moderators of symptom change.ResultsCompared to TEs, individuals with PTSD more often reported living alone and experiencing a physical illness (χ2 = 5.1, df = 1, p = 0.02). PCL-5 scores among individuals with PTSD decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic by 7.1 points (t(69) = -3.5, p = 0.0008), whereas the TE group did not change significantly. Overall no significant differences in HRSD were found between groups, but a race or ethnicity variable was found to moderate HRSD symptom change. Non-black or Hispanic individuals with PTSD experienced significantly increased HRSD scores during the pandemic compared to black or Hispanic PTSD participants.ConclusionThe findings are indicative of complexity in the responses of older individuals with PTSD to further stressful life events as well as possibly unique aspects to the COVID-19 pandemic as a stressor. Sources of resilience may exist based on experience with prior traumas as well as increasing age promoting more adaptive coping styles.",938

However, data are limited regarding long-term post-traumatic stress (PTSD) in HCT survivors and its risk factors. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis examining longitudinal data from 250 patients who underwent autologous and allogenic HCT. We used the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist (PTSD-CL) to assess for PTSD symptoms at six months post-HCT. We used the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess quality of life (QOL), depression, and anxiety symptoms at the time of admission for HCT, at week-2 during hospitalization, and at six months post-HCT. We used multivariate regression models to assess factors associated with PTSD symptoms, modeling QOL, depression, and anxiety symptoms separately given their collinearity. Results: The mean age was 56.3 (SD = 13.3). The rate of clinically significant PTSD symptoms at six months post-HCT was 18.9% and these patients experienced hypervigilance (92.3%), avoidance (92.3%), and intrusion (76.9%) symptoms. Among patients without clinically significant PTSD symptoms, 24.5% and 13.7% had clinically significant hypervigilance and avoidance symptoms, respectively. Lower QOL at time of HCT admission (B = -0.04, P = 0.004), and being single (B = -3.35, P = 0.027) were associated with higher PTSD symptoms at six months post-HCT. Higher anxiety at time of HCT admission (B = 1.34, P &lt; 0.001), change in anxiety during HCT hospitalization (B = 0.59, P = 0.006), and being single (B = -3.50, P = 0.017), were associated with higher PTSD symptoms at six months. In a separate model, younger age (B = -0.13, P = 0.017), being single (B = -3.58, P = 0.018), and higher baseline depression symptoms were also associated with higher PTSD symptoms at six months (B = 0.97, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Approximately one fifth of patients undergoing HCT experienced clinically significant PTSD symptoms at six months post-transplant. Patients’ baseline QOL and psychological symptoms emerged as important predictors of their risk for PTSD at six months post-HCT. Thus, interventions to prevent and treat PTSD symptoms in HCT recipients are clearly warranted.",939

Method: Participants (n=190) were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory State Subscale (STAI-S), the PTSD Checklist Civilian (PCL-C) Version and the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST).
Results: Although severity of the state of anxiety predicted the severity of alcohol-related problems in the first and depression in the second step of a linear regression model, when severity of PTSD symptoms was included in the analysis, it was the only independent variable that predicted the severity of alcohol-related problems while the state of anxiety and depression were no longer predictors. 
Conclusion: These findings suggest that the severity of PTSD symptoms is related to the severity of alcohol-related problems, independent from severity of state anxiety and depression among inpatients with AUD.",940
https://openalex.org/W2731730418,,Coping Strategies of PTSD Patients,"Trauma can be caused by an overwhelmingly negative event that causes a lasting impact on the victim's mental and emotional stability. Many sources of trauma are physically violent in nature, while others are psychological. Reactions to traumatic events vary from individual to individual as the appraisal of the traumatic event and the ability to cope with it often differs across individuals. The aim of the present study was to investigate the coping patterns of the patients with post traumatic symptoms. Results highlight the coping patterns of trauma affected subjects. Present investigation included 10 PTSD patients and 10 normal adult (18 to 40 years) subjects. Sample included both male and female hospitalized cases from various Trauma Centers of Varanasi. The level of the trauma symptoms was assessed with the PTSD checklist-civilian version. The level of coping pattern was assessed with the Coping Strategies Scale. As hypothesized the coping strategies of PTSD patients reported higher score on avoidance coping strategies than their normal subject counterparts.",941

Many literatures from other parts of the world have addressed the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder among road traffic accident survivors, but such studies are mostly unavailable in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study examined the prevalence and determinants of PTSD among RTA survivors attending selected hospitals in southern Ethiopia. Methods Institution based cross-sectional study design was employed from April 1/2018-Sep 30/2019. Data were collected from a sample of consecutively selected 423 RTA survivors through an interviewer-administered technique. A pre-tested post-traumatic stress disorder Checklist-Specific version (PCL-S) tool was used to screen PTSD. Data were entered and analysed using SPSS 22 software. A logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of PTSD. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the level of significance with a p -value of less than 0.05. Result A total of 416 participants were included in the study and the response rate was 98.6%. The prevalence of probable PTSD among RTA survivors was 15.4% (64). After adjusting for the effects of potential confounding variables; time since accident (30–90 days) (AOR = 0.33; 95%CI (0.15, 0.73), history of previous road traffic accident (AOR = 2.67; 95%CI (1.23, 5.77), depressive symptoms (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI (1.10, 6.10)) and common mental disorder (AOR = 12.78, 95% CI (5.56, 29.36)) were significant determinants of PTSD. Conclusion The prevalence of probable PTSD in the current study was high (15.4%). Time since accident, history of a previous road traffic accident, having depressive symptoms and common mental disorder were significant determinants of PTSD. RTA survivors attending adult Emergency and orthopedic clinics need to be screened for PTSD and get appropriate management.",942

Methods We examined the association of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms with SLE incidence over 24 years of follow‐up in a US longitudinal cohort of women (n = 54,763). Incident SLE in women meeting ≥4 American College of Rheumatology criteria was ascertained by self‐report and confirmed by medical record review. PTSD and trauma exposure were assessed with the Short Screening Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition PTSD and the Brief Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. Women were categorized as having no trauma, trauma and no PTSD symptoms, subclinical PTSD (1–3 symptoms), or probable PTSD (4–7 symptoms). We examined whether longitudinally assessed health risk factors (e.g., smoking, body mass index [ BMI ], oral contraceptive use) accounted for increased SLE risk among women with trauma exposure and PTSD versus those without. Results During follow‐up, 73 cases of SLE occurred. Compared to women with no trauma, probable PTSD was associated with increased SLE risk (for 4–7 symptoms, hazard ratio [ HR ] 2.94 [95% confidence interval {95% CI } 1.19–7.26], P &lt; 0.05). Subclinical PTSD was associated with increased SLE risk, although this did not reach statistical significance (for 1–3 symptoms, HR 1.83 [95% CI 0.74–4.56], P = 0.19). Smoking, BMI , and oral contraceptive use slightly attenuated the associations (e.g., for 4–7 symptoms, adjusted HR 2.62 [95% CI 1.09–6.48], P &lt; 0.05). Trauma exposure, regardless of PTSD symptoms, was strongly associated with incident SLE ( HR 2.83 [95% CI 1.29–6.21], P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion This study contributes to growing evidence that psychosocial trauma and associated stress responses may lead to autoimmune disease.",944
https://openalex.org/W2955792165,,Relationship between personality traits and prognosis of posttraumatic stress disorder in flood survivors,"Objective:To explore the prognosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in flood survivors 13 years after they had been diagnosed with PTSD symptoms,and investigate the relationship between their personality traits and the prognosis of PTSD.Method:In this cross-sectional study,the survivors of Dongting Lake flood in 1998-1999 in Hunan in China,who were investigated and screened as PTSD symptoms positive in 2000 were selected as the target population,from which a sample of 200subjects was drawn using amulti-stage random sampling method.The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale Civilian Version (PCL-C) was used to examine and re-screen the participants of PTSD symptoms in order to explore the prognosis of PTSD.Participants whose PCL-C scores were equal to 44 or higher were classified as the PTSD symptoms positive group,while those with PCL-C scores less than 44 were classified as the recovered group.Personality traits were then assessed,using the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale for Chinese (EPQ-RSC),in both the recovered group and the PTSD symptoms positive group.Finally,the multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the prognosis of PTSD and personality traits.Results:Totally 200 subjects were eligible for this study and completed the questionnaires,but 16 of them had their questionnaires excluded from data analysis because they provided incomplete information.Thus,the response rate was 92.0％.According to the PCL-C's cut-off score,22 participants were still screened as PTSD symptoms positive and were classified as the PTSD symptoms positive group,whereas the other 162 participants were screened as PTSD symptoms negative and were classified as the recovered group.Compared with the recovered group,the EPQ-RSC extroversion scores for the PTSD symptoms positive group were significantly lower [(51.8 ± 10.7) vs.(45.1 ± 13.2),P ＜ 0.05] and their neuroticism scores were significantly higher [(46.5 ± 10.1) vs.(58.3 ± 12.2),P ＜ 0.05].The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed,after adjusting for the variables such as gender and age,that higher neuroticism (OR ＝ 3.63,95％ CI:1.05 -12.54) was a risk factor for the persistent PTSD symptoms in the flood survivors.Conclusions:It suggests that neuroticism is associated with prognosis of PTSD in flood survivors,those with higher neuroticism scores appear to have problems to recover from PTSD.",945

https://openalex.org/W2993924784,10.1176/appi.ps.201900226,Contribution of Critical Events and Chronic Stressors to PTSD Symptoms Among Psychiatric Workers,"Objective: Psychiatric staff are exposed to critical events (e.g., violence, physical threats) in the workplace and thus are at risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The authors examined the prevalence of PTSD symptoms among psychiatric hospital staff in Canada and the role of potentially traumatic critical events and chronic stressors (e.g., witnessing patients engaging in self-injury) in affecting psychiatric staff’s mental health. Methods: The authors analyzed cross-sectional survey data from 761 psychiatric staff (69% female, 57% nursing, 64% with more than 5 years of experience in mental health). The analysis focused on questions about exposure to critical events and chronic stressors. Results: Sixteen percent of participants met a screening cutoff score on the PTSD Checklist-5, a self-report PTSD measure. Almost all staff (96%) had been directly or indirectly exposed to at least one critical event, and two-thirds (67%) had been directly exposed to at least one such event. Nursing staff reported higher scores than did allied health staff. A regression analysis yielded a model in which both critical events and chronic stressors were significant contributors to the variance in PTSD symptoms; professional discipline and gender did not explain additional variance. Conclusions: PTSD is a significant concern for psychiatric staff. Exposure to violence and chronic stressors were found to contribute significantly and independently to explaining PTSD symptom checklist scores.",947
https://openalex.org/W2972791443,10.31486/toj.18.0144,The Relationship Between Grit and Resilience in Emergency Medical Service Personnel,"<h3></h3> <b>Background:</b> Emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are regularly exposed to traumatic incidents and experience higher rates of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than the general population. Grit is a construct proposed to be associated with achievement, but it has demonstrated preliminary evidence of an association with resilience. The current study examined the relationship between grit and resilience among EMS workers. <b>Methods:</b> A link to an online survey was sent to East Baton Rouge Parish Emergency Medical Services personnel via an email distribution list. Demographic variables and the following self-report measures were assessed: the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Grit Scale, the Brief COPE scale, and the Professional Exposure to Traumatic Experiences scale (modified from the Life Events Checklist). <b>Results:</b> PCL-5 scores were significantly and negatively correlated with the Grit Scale score (r=–0.57, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Hierarchical regression revealed that grit and coping mechanisms were predictive of self-reported PTSD symptoms (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>=68.7%, F(15,67)=9.81, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Examination of the coefficients revealed that lower total Grit Scale scores and higher scores on the following Brief COPE scales were significant predictors of PCL-5 scores: denial, substance abuse, disengagement, and self-blame. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study examined the relationship between grit and resilience, measured by self-reported PTSD symptoms. Our results demonstrate a significant relationship between grit and resilience. Grit is related to, but distinct from, other constructs that predict resilience, such as coping mechanisms. Large prospective studies could have significant implications for hiring practices and building grit in existing personnel to bolster resilience.",948

Although research shows the risk for psychiatric and substance use comorbidity conferred by early adversity, most studies have not modeled multivariate symptom patterns that include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom criteria (i.e., re-experiencing, effortful avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal). The aim of the present study was to model multivariate patterns of substance use and psychiatric symptoms, including PTSD criteria, and examine associations between these patterns and early adversity.Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used in a large, nonclinical sample of community adults (N = 1,431). Relations between profile membership, cumulative ACEs, and demographic covariates were then evaluated.Results indicated four distinct profiles of psychiatric symptom comorbidity (PSC): (a) PTSD dominant with elevated illicit drug and cannabis use; (b) anxiety and depression dominant with elevated use across substances; (c) avoidance dominant with low severity of all other psychiatric symptoms and substance use; and (d) psychiatrically healthy. Analyses identified significant associations between profile membership and cumulative ACEs and other traumatic events. Cumulative ACEs and traumatic events were highest among the PTSD dominant profile.A greater understanding of heterogeneous patterns of PSC may allow for future development of treatment care paths that correspond to standard criteria of symptom presentation and severity.",949
https://openalex.org/W2953558484,10.1002/jts.22412,Predictors for Excellent Versus Partial Response to Prolonged Exposure Therapy: Who Needs Additional Sessions?,"Abstract In practice, the duration of psychotherapy is determined by the patient's response to treatment. Identifying predictors for treatment responses is of great clinical utility to guide clinicians in their treatment planning. Demographic characteristics, trauma history, comorbidity, and early reduction of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were examined as predictors of excellent versus partial response to prolonged exposure therapy (PE) for PTSD. Participants were 96 female assault survivors with chronic PTSD who received at least eight PE sessions with or without cognitive restructuring. Participants were classified as excellent responders ( n = 27) or partial responders ( n = 69) based on whether they achieved at least 70% improvement in self‐reported PTSD severity on the PTSD Symptom Scale–Self‐Report at the end of Session 8. Excellent responders terminated therapy after Session 9, and partial responders were offered up to three additional sessions. Logistic regression was conducted to investigate predictors of response to PE. Results showed that prior interpersonal violence and comorbid alcohol use disorder were associated with partial response. Comorbid depressive disorder and early PTSD symptom reduction were associated with excellent response. Being treated by a cognitive behavioral therapy expert predicted higher excellent response for patients with a history of prior interpersonal violence. The model accounted for 56.6% of the variance in treatment response and correctly predicted responder status for 83.3% of the sample. These findings contribute to the field's understanding of factors that predict or moderate response to PE and have implications for treatment planning.",950

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single academic neuroscience ICU from November 2017 to September 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutively enrolled sample of family members, one for each ICU patient with a minimum length of stay of 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Near time of ICU discharge or patient death, we determined each participant’s psychologic attachment orientation as anxious versus nonanxious via a brief standard survey tool, the Relationship Questionnaire, and measured other participant and patient characteristics as potential covariates. Six months after discharge or death, each participant completed the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) to measure PTSD symptoms, with a score of greater than 24 indicative of clinically significant symptoms. Among 162 total participants, 10 of 27 participants (37.0%) with an anxious attachment orientation reported 6-month PTSD symptoms, compared with 24 of 135 nonanxious participants (17.8%) (relative risk, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.13–3.84; p = 0.02; risk difference 19.2%). In a subsequent univariate analysis of participant and patient covariates, anxious attachment orientation, participant Hispanic ethnicity, prior experience as a care partner of a patient with a disability, and participation in 3 or more formal ICU family meetings were all associated with 6-month PTSD symptoms. In a multiple logistic regression, anxious attachment remained an independent predictor of 6-month PTSD symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 3.64; 95% CI, 1.35–9.77; p = 0.01), as did Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.34–16.6; p = 0.01) and participation in three or more ICU family meetings (odds ratio, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.14–7.68; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: An anxious psychologic attachment orientation is associated with double the risk of long-term PTSD symptoms among family members of ICU patients. Future interventions designed to decrease risk of adverse psychologic outcomes among ICU families could be initially tested for efficacy amongst those who fall into this high-risk category.",951

However, to our knowledge, there is no study investigating the effect of PTSD-related trauma type on plasma CRP levels. This study was planned to determine the effect of PTSD and PTSD-related trauma type on plasma CRP levels. Methods: The sample of this cross-sectional study consisted of 73 PTSD patients and 69 healthy control subjects. After proper blood collection, Clinician-administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was administered by the researchers and Sociodemographic Data Form, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) were requested. Results: CRP, BDI and DES scores of PTSD patients were statistically higher than healthy controls. There were statistically signifi-cant differences between plasma CRP level, CAPS and DES scores according to different trauma types. In the comparison of bilateral groups, plasma CRP levels of occupational accident-induced PTSD patients were statis-tically higher than patients with PTSD due to other types of trauma. Conclusion: As a result, there were differences in plasma CRP levels between PTSD patients and healthy control group and plasma CRP levels were found to vary with the type of trauma associated with PTSD.",952

Although the diagnostic criteria for ASD were altered and structured more similarly to the PTSD definition in DSM-5, only the PTSD diagnosis includes a dissociative subtype. Emerging research has indicated that there also appears to be a highly symptomatic subtype for ASD. However, the specific nature of the subtype is currently unclear. The present study investigates the possible presence of ASD subtypes in a mixed sample of victims meeting caseness for DSM-5 ASD based on self-report following four different types of traumatic exposure (N = 472). The results of latent profile analysis revealed a 5-class solution. The highly symptomatic class was marked by high endorsement on avoidance and dissociation compared to the other classes. Findings are discussed in regard to its clinical implications including the implications for the pending the ICD-11 and the recently released DSM-5.",953

Methods The program was based on an online platform and consisted of eight 15-min sessions that included script-guided imagery and supportive music. Thirty-five patients with workplace-related PTSD participated in this program 4 days per week for 4 weeks. Its effects were examined using self-report questionnaires before and after the take-home online treatment sessions. Results After completing the 4-week treatment program, patients showed significant improvements in depressed mood (t=3.642, p=0.001) based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), anxiety (t=3.198, p=0.003) based on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item (GAD-7) scale, and PTSD symptoms (t=5.363, p<0.001) based on the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Check List (PCL). In particular, patients with adverse childhood experiences exhibited a greater degree of relief related to anxiety and PTSD symptoms than those without adverse childhood experiences.

https://openalex.org/W3030056097,10.1093/sleep/zsaa056.464,0467 Benefits of CBT-I for Women Veterans with and without PTSD,"Abstract Introduction A quarter of women Veterans (WVs) receiving VA healthcare meet diagnostic criteria for both insomnia disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is effective at improving sleep among individuals with comorbid psychiatric conditions; however, no studies have examined the impact of CBT-I in women with insomnia plus PTSD. The current analyses examined changes in sleep symptoms, quality of life (QoL), and mental health symptoms from pre- to post-CBT-I in WVs with and without PTSD. Methods This was a secondary analysis of 75 WVs with insomnia (32 with probable PTSD), who received CBT-I within a behavioral sleep intervention study (NCT02076165). Measures completed at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up included: insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist-5, PCL-5; probable PTSD=total score ≥33), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Qestionnaire-9, PHQ-9), and mental and physical quality of life (Short Form Health Survey, SF-12). One sample T-tests examined changes in ISI, PSQI, PHQ-9, PCL-5, and SF-12 from baseline to posttreatment and baseline to follow-up. Two samples T-tests compared change scores in ISI, PSQI, PHQ-9, and SF-12 between participants with and without PTSD. Results There were significant improvements in ISI (p≤.001), PSQI (p≤.001), PHQ-9 (p≤.001), PCL-5 (p=.001), and SF-12 mental (p≤.001) and physical (p=.03) from baseline to posttreatment and 3-month follow-up (p≤.001-.01). There were no significant change score differences between WVs with and without PTSD from baseline to posttreatment (p=.06-.98) or 3-month follow-up (p=.09-.93). Conclusion CBT-I appears to be an effective treatment to improve insomnia symptoms among WVs with and without PTSD, and may reduce psychiatric symptoms as well. These findings suggest WVs with comorbid insomnia and PTSD benefit from CBT-I. The appropriate sequencing of CBT-I and PTSD treatments remains potentially important, but unstudied.

The aim of this paper is intended to assess the symptoms severity of this mental disorder, as well as to detect probable malingering and symptom exaggeration among victims of gender violence in a forensic context. The sample consisted of 526 victims of sexual or family violence who sought therapy and 74 victims of the same kind who filed a complaint in court. Symptom severity was higher in victims assessed in the forensic context than in victims assessed in the clinical context. Items designed to detect probable malingering adequately discriminated between the two groups (t = 7.3, g = 0.97). A cut-off point of 2 in the subscale of malingering is appropriate to correctly classify the 74% of probable malingerers. This scale is useful for forensic assessment in victims of PTSD.",957

The data was collected on a predefined questionnaire including age, gender, mode of injury, weapon of the injury, type of assault (blunt or penetrating), firearm injuries, and road traffic accidents from medico-legal registers. Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to assess Post-traumatic stress disorder.&#x0D; Results: The mean age (SD) of victims was 29.3 (10.25) years. Blunt injuries were experienced by 47 (31.33%) victims. The majority of the victims suffered road traffic collision injuries, 59 (39.33%). Forty-eight (32%) victims had substantially higher IES scores (above 37) that confirmed severe PTSD that may contribute to the suppression of the immune system’s functioning among survivors. The majority of the victims were between 18 and 40 years.&#x0D; Conclusion: The most common cases were related to road traffic collisions followed by blunt injuries. The incidence rate of PTSD was also prevalent in these individuals. Thus, strategies should be developed to prevent such incidents and those who suffer from such traumatic events must be offered psychiatric consultation.",958

Treatment duration (i.e., number of sessions) was determined by either achievement of a criterion score on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5; PTSD Checklist for DSM-5) for two consecutive sessions or completion of 15 sessions. Participants received PE via HBT (n = 58), OBT (n = 59) or IHIP (n = 58). Data were collected between 2012 and 2018, and PTSD was diagnosed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), administered at baseline, posttreatment, and 6 months following treatment completion. The primary clinical outcome was CAPS-5 PTSD severity. Secondary outcomes included self-reported PTSD and depression symptoms, as well as treatment dropout.The clinical effectiveness of PE did not differ by treatment modality across any time point; however, there was a significant difference in treatment dropout.

The proposal has received support from research among clinical and community samples alike but only few studies have tested the validity of these disorders in a sample of refugees using the International Trauma Questionnaire especially designed for assessment of ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD.Latent class analysis was used to test the validity of the ICD-11 PTSD and CPTSD distinction in a heterogeneous group of 284 highly symptomatic refugees registered for treatment at a Danish treatment-center.A two-class solution fit the data best. One group reported elevated levels of PTSD-symptoms and symptoms of affective dysregulation, and one group reported elevated levels of symptoms corresponding to CPTSD. The CPTSD group was considerably larger than the PTSD-group.The current study supports the ICD-11 distinction between PTSD and CPTSD in a sample of treatment-seeking refugees. The assistance of interpreters was needed for some of the participants which affected the reliability of the assessment.The ICD-11 proposal for PTSD and CPTSD is supported in a heterogenous sample of refugees using the ITQ.",961

However, it is unclear how such symptoms are captured on tools used for behavioural and psychiatric assessment in this population. To explore whether and how PTEs are associated with symptom reports in adults with ASD and ID. Associations and group differences for death of a close relative and serious disease/injury in a close relative/caregiver/friend were explored in a clinical sample of 171 adults with ASD and ID referred for psychiatric assessment. Symptoms were measured using Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Psychopathology in Autism Checklist (PAC). Disease/injury was associated with higher scores on ABC irritability, ABC hyperactivity and self-injurious behaviour. Death was associated with lower scores on ABC lethargy and ABC stereotypic behaviour. Some associations reached significance only when controlling for ASD, ID, or verbal language skills, but the identified associations were not robust. No associations were found for PAC. There is a risk of under-appreciating the impact of PTEs in this population unless ASD, ID and verbal language skills are taken into account.",962

We tested the moderating effects of trauma type for three psychotherapies in 110 unmedicated patients with chronic DSM-IV PTSD.Patients were randomized to 14 weeks of prolonged exposure (PE, N = 38), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT, N = 40), or relaxation therapy (RT, N = 32). The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was the primary outcome measure. Moderator candidates were trauma type: interpersonal, sexual, physical. We fit a regression model for week 14 CAPS as a function of treatment (a three-level factor), an indicator of trauma type presence/absence, and their interactions, controlling for baseline CAPS, and evaluated potential confounds.Thirty-nine (35%) patients reported sexual, 68 (62%) physical, and 102 (93%) interpersonal trauma. Baseline CAPS scores did not differ by presence/absence of trauma types. Sexual trauma as PTSD criterion A significantly moderated treatment effect: whereas all therapies had similar efficacy among nonsexually-traumatized patients, IPT had greater efficacy among sexually traumatized patients (efficacy difference with and without sexual trauma: IPT vs. PE and IPT vs. RT P's < .05), specifically in PTSD symptom clusters B and D (P's < .05).Few studies have assessed effects of varying trauma types on effects of differing psychotherapies. In this exploratory study, sexual trauma moderated PTSD outcomes of three therapies: IPT showed greater benefit for sexually traumatized patients than PE or RT. The IPT focuses on affect to help patients determine trust in their current environments may particularly benefit patients who have suffered sexual assault.",963

However, its lack of empirical evidence of safety and effectiveness has been criticized.To assess the effectiveness of PFA-ABCDE, an original PFA protocol, for preventing PTSD one month after the intervention and decreasing PTSD symptoms at one and six months of follow up.We assessed the eligibility of 1,140 adult survivors of recent trauma (≤ 72 hours) consulting five emergency departments in Chile. Two hundred twenty-one were randomized to receive either PFA-ABCDE (active listening, breathing retraining, categorization of needs, referral to ancillary services, and psychoeducation) or only psychoeducation. We used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to assess PTSD diagnosis. The Posttraumatic Checklist (PCL), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and a 0-10 points analogue visual scale were used to assess PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and immediate distress relief after the intervention.We found no difference between the experimental and control groups in the frequency of PTSD one month after the intervention (PFA-ABCDE = 23/76 [30.3%], psychoeducation = 18/75 [24.0%], adjusted odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.63-3.07, p = .408). Immediately after the intervention, participants who received PFA-ABCDE reported greater distress relief (PFA-ABCDE mean = 9.06, psychoeducation mean = 8.55, Cohen's d = 0.30, p = .038). Fewer PTSD symptoms were reported by those who received PFA-ABCDE one month after the intervention (PFA-ABCDE mean = 36.26, psychoeducation mean = 43.62, Cohen's d = 0.42, p = .033). We found no difference in depressive symptoms at one-month follow up (p = .713) nor in PTSD symptoms six months after the intervention (p = .986).PFA-ABCDE does not prevent PTSD diagnosis, but it provides immediate distress relief and decreases PTSD symptoms in the short term.Antecedentes: Los Primeros Auxilios Psicológicos (PAP) han sido recomendados para prevenir el Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático (TEPT) en supervivientes de trauma. A pesar de su popularidad, la escasez de evidencia empírica sobre su seguridad y efectividad ha sido criticada.Objetivos: Evaluar la efectividad de los PAP-ABCDE, un protocolo original de PAP, para prevenir el TEPT al mes de seguimiento y disminuir los síntomas de TEPT luego de uno y seis meses de seguimiento.Métodos: Evaluamos elegibilidad de 1.140 adultos supervivientes de trauma reciente (≤ 72 horas) que consultaron cinco servicios de urgencia en Chile. Doscientos veintiún fueron aleatorizados a recibir PAP-ABCDE (escucha activa, reentrenamiento de la respiración, categorización de necesidades, derivación a redes de apoyo, y psicoeducación) o sólo psicoeducación. Utilizamos la Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) para evaluar el diagnóstico de TEPT. La Posttraumatic Checklist (PCL), la Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), y una escala visual análoga de 0-10 puntos fueron utilizadas para evaluar síntomas de TEPT, síntomas depresivos, y alivio inmediato de distrés luego de la intervención.Resultados: No encontramos diferencia entre el grupo experimental y el grupo control en la frecuencia de TEPT un mes después de la intervención (PAP-ABCDE = 23/76 [30,3%], psicoeducación = 18/75 [24,0%], odds ratio ajustado = 1,39, intervalo de confianza 95% = 0,63-3,07, p = ,408). Inmediatamente después de la intervención los participantes que recibieron PAP-ABCDE reportaron un mayor alivio de distrés (media en PAP = 9,06, media en psicoeducación = 8,55, d de Cohen = 0,30, p = ,038). Menos síntomas de TEPT fueron reportados un mes después de la intervención por aquellos que recibieron PAP-ABCDE (media de PAP-ABCDE = 36,26, media de psicoeducación = 43,62, d de Cohen = 0,42, p = ,033). No encontramos diferencias en síntomas depresivos al mes de seguimiento (p = ,713) ni en síntomas de TEPT seis meses después de la intervención (p = ,986).Conclusiones: Los PAP-ABCDE no previenen el diagnóstico de TEPT, pero brindan alivio inmediato del distrés y disminuyen la severidad de los síntomas del TEPT en el corto plazo.背景: 早期心理急救 (PFA) 已被广泛推荐用于预防创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD)。然而, 其安全性和有效性的缺乏实证证据受到批评。目的: 评估 PFA-ABCDE (原始 PFA 方案) 在干预后 1 个月预防 PTSD 并在随访 1 个月和 6 个月时减少 PTSD 症状的有效性。方法: 我们评估了 1140 名咨询了智利五个急诊科的近期创伤 (≤ 72 小时) 成年幸存者的资格。 221 人随机接受 PFA-ABCDE (积极倾听, 呼吸再训练, 需求分类, 转介辅助服务和心理教育) 或仅接受心理教育。我们使用复合国际诊断访谈 (CIDI) 来评估 PTSD 诊断。创伤后检查表 (PCL), 贝克抑郁量表-II (BDI-II) 和 0-10 分模拟视觉量表用于评估干预后的 PTSD 症状, 抑郁症状和即时痛苦缓解。结果: 我们发现干预后 1 个月的 PTSD 发生率在实验组和对照组之间没有差异 (PFA-ABCDE = 23/76 [30.3%], 心理教育 = 18/75 [24.0%], 调整优势比 = 1.39, 95% 置信区间 = 0.63-3.07, p= .408)。干预一结束, 接受 PFA-ABCDE 的参与者报告了更大的痛苦缓解 (PFA-ABCDE 平均值 = 9.06, 心理教育平均值 = 8.55, Cohen’s d= 0.30, p= .038) 。干预后一个月接受 PFA-ABCDE 的患者报告的 PTSD 症状较少 (PFA-ABCDE 平均值 = 36.26, 心理教育平均值 = 43.62, Cohen’s d= 0.42, p= .033) 。我们发现在 1 个月的随访中抑郁症状 (p= .713) 和干预后 6 个月的 PTSD 症状 (p= .986) 没有差异。结论: PFA-ABCDE 不能预防 PTSD 诊断, 但它可以立即缓解痛苦并在短期内减轻 PTSD 症状。.",964

Objective We extended this research by examining PTSD and exposure to violence and other disturbing patient behaviors, among nursing and other staff on inpatient psychiatric units (forensic and nonforensic). Method Surveys were completed online or in person by 219 respondents (30% response rate). Participants indicated which disturbing behaviors they had been exposed to and ranked the worst three behaviors in each of three categories: most unpleasant to work with, most disruptive to patient care, and most upsetting. Most ( n = 192) also completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Results All but two participants reported exposure to at least one disturbing behavior and ranked violence, feces smearing, and screaming constantly as the worst experiences overall. On the PCL, 24% scored above the cut off for probable PTSD. Nursing staff had the highest scores, with no difference between nursing staff on forensic versus nonforensic units. PCL score showed a small positive correlation with the number of disturbing behaviors experienced. Conclusion PTSD symptoms are common among psychiatric hospital workers, not only nursing staff. Future research using clinical assessment, longitudinal designs, and measurement of nonviolent disturbing behaviors is recommended.",965

A history of (chronic) traumatisation during childhood has been linked to the development of distinct symptoms that are often labelled as symptoms of complex PTSD. Many therapists associate the presence of symptoms of complex PTSD with a less favourable treatment prognosis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a phase-based approach is more effective than stand-alone trauma-focused therapy in individuals with PTSD and possible symptoms of complex PTSD resulting from a history of repeated sexual and/or physical abuse in childhood. An additional aim is to investigate moderators, predictors of treatment (non) response and drop-out.The sample consists of patients between 18 and 65 years old with a diagnosis of PTSD who report a history of repeated sexual and/or physical abuse in childhood (N = 122). Patients will be blindly allocated to either 16 sessions of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy preceded by a stabilization phase (eight sessions of Skills Training in Affect and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR)) or only 16 sessions of EMDR therapy. Assessments are carried out pre-treatment, after every eighth session, post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months follow up. The main parameter will be the severity of PTSD symptoms (PTSD Symptoms Scale-Self Report). Secondary outcome variables are the presence of a PTSD diagnosis (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5), severity of complex PTSD symptoms (Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress-Revised and symptoms-specific questionnaires), changes in symptoms of general psychopathology (Brief Symptom Inventory), and quality of life (Euroqol-5D). Health care consumption and productivity loss in patients will also be indexed.The study results may help to inform the ongoing debate about whether a phase-based approach has added value over immediate trauma-focused therapy in patients suffering from PTSD due to childhood abuse. Furthermore, the results will contribute to knowledge about the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of treatments in this target group.Nederlands Trialregister, NTR5991 .

The memories that survivors have from the ICU may play a role in developing PTSD. Aim This study aimed to determine the prevalence of PTSD‐related symptoms in ICU survivors in Southeast Iran and its relationship with their memories of the ICU. Methods In this descriptive correlational study, 100 people discharged from ICUs in southeastern Iran completed the Impact of Event Scale‐Revised (IES‐R) and ICU memory tool (ICU‐MT). Results Findings indicated that, from 100 participants who, on average, were assessed 3.19 ± 5.37 months after discharge, 13% were suffering from PTSD. The total mean IES‐R score and the scores of “Intrusion,” “Avoidance,” and “Hyperarousal” subscales in patients with delusional memories were higher compared with the patients who did not have such memories. In the patients who were mechanically ventilated at the time of their stay in the ICU, the total mean IES‐R score was 6.86 times higher ( P = .03). Conclusion This research provided further evidence of the relationship between delusional memories and PTSD in patients who had been discharged from the ICU. Relevance to clinical practice In the care of patients admitted to the ICU, preventive strategies should be used to minimize delusional memories and PTSD. It is necessary to detect post‐ICU psychiatric morbidities and provide early psychological intervention in post‐discharge follow‐up programmes to improve psychological outcomes after critical illness.",968

There were 134 adult treatment-seeking, severely and multiply traumatized patients from various refugee backgrounds were assessed in their mother tongue using a computerized set of questionnaires consisting of a trauma list, the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale, and the new PTSD items that had been suggested by the DSM-5 Task Force of the American Psychiatric Association. Using DSM-IV, 60.4% of participants met diagnostic criteria for PTSD; using DSM-5, only 49.3% fulfilled all criteria (p < .001). Confirmatory factor analysis of DSM-IV and DSM-5 items showed good and comparable model fits. Furthermore, classification functions in the DSM-5 were satisfactory. The new Cluster D symptoms showed relatively high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power, and negative predictive power. The DSM-5 symptom structure appears to be applicable to traumatized refugees. Negative alterations in cognitions and mood may be especially useful for clinicians, not only to determine the extent to which an individual refugee is likely to meet criteria for PTSD, but also in providing targets for clinical intervention.",969

Research suggests, however, that some people who experience trauma, including veterans, report posttraumatic growth (PTG), or positive personal changes following adversity. In this study, we tested a comprehensive model of PTG, PTSD, and satisfaction with life in a veteran population, exploring the roles of challenges to core beliefs, types of rumination, sex, and time since event. Method: Data were collected via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing website, from veterans (N = 197) who had experienced a stressful event within the last 3 years (M = 16.66 months, SD = 12.27 months). Structural equation modeling was used to test an integrated conceptual model of PTG, PTSD, and satisfaction with life. Results: Results showed that challenge to core beliefs was directly associated with both deliberate and intrusive rumination. Deliberate rumination was positively related to PTG; intrusive rumination was positively related to symptoms of PTSD. PTG and PTSD, in turn, mediated the relationship between rumination styles and satisfaction with life; PTG was related to higher satisfaction with life; and PTSD was negatively related to satisfaction with life. Results failed to show differences on any model variables as a function of time since event or sex. Conclusion: Results indicate that the intentional facilitation of PTG may be a complementary and alternative option to the reduction of PTSD symptoms for improving satisfaction with life. Findings suggest that efforts to facilitate PTG should be focused on strategies for promoting deliberate rumination.",970

However, there is still a lack of studies specific to youths. Objective: This study sought to investigate the latent dimensions of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms in a sample of adolescents exposed to an explosion accident. Method: Participants were 836 students (407 females and 428 males). Self-reported measures including the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and the anxiety and depression subscales of the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale were administered to participants. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was implemented to test competing factor models. Results: A seven-factor model composed of intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing behaviours, anxious arousal and dysphoric arousal factors emerged as the best fitting model, and PTSD's factors displayed distinguishable correlations with external measures of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: The findings provide and extend empirical evidence supporting the newly refined seven-factor hybrid model of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and have implications for further trauma-related clinical practice and research.",971

Assessing the validity of the ICD-11 model of PTSD across multiple trauma samples,"BackgroundIn the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the symptom profile of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was expanded to include 20 symptoms. An alternative model of PTSD is outlined in the proposed 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) that includes just six symptoms.Objectives and methodThe objectives of the current study are: 1) to independently investigate the fit of the ICD-11 model of PTSD, and three DSM-5-based models of PTSD, across seven different trauma samples (N=3,746) using confirmatory factor analysis; 2) to assess the concurrent validity of the ICD-11 model of PTSD; and 3) to determine if there are significant differences in diagnostic rates between the ICD-11 guidelines and the DSM-5 criteria.ResultsThe ICD-11 model of PTSD was found to provide excellent model fit in six of the seven trauma samples, and tests of factorial invariance showed that the model performs equally well for males and females. DSM-5 models provided poor fit of the data. Concurrent validity was established as the ICD-11 PTSD factors were all moderately to strongly correlated with scores of depression, anxiety, dissociation, and aggression. Levels of association were similar for ICD-11 and DSM-5 suggesting that explanatory power is not affected due to the limited number of items included in the ICD-11 model. Diagnostic rates were significantly lower according to ICD-11 guidelines compared to the DSM-5 criteria.ConclusionsThe proposed factor structure of the ICD-11 model of PTSD appears valid across multiple trauma types, possesses good concurrent validity, and is more stringent in terms of diagnosis compared to the DSM-5 criteria.",972

In addition, there is some evidence that these variables have different effects on PTSD and PTG, although the latter construct has been the target of a larger body of research and theoretical models. The main objective of the current study is to examine the effect of challenges to core beliefs, intrusive rumination, and deliberate rumination on PTSD and PTG, through an item-level analyses. Methods: The sample was composed of 205 Portuguese women who had been given a breast cancer diagnosis (M = 54.32, SD = 10.05), and who completed the following self-administered questionnaires: the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-C); the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI); the Core Beliefs Inventory; and the Event Related Rumination Inventory. Two multivariate multiple regression analyses, using each item of the PCL-C and the PTGI as dependent variables, were conducted. Results: The results demonstrated that challenges to core beliefs predict 17 of the 21 PTGI items and 12 of the 17 PCL-C items. All but one item of the PCL-C are predicted by intrusive rumination, while the variance of only 4 items of the PTGI are explained by deliberate rumination. Conclusions: These findings indicate that women with breast cancer who tend to display higher levels of intrusive rumination are more likely to report PTSD symptoms, and that an examination of one’s core beliefs is predictor of both positive and negative outcomes. In spite of the proven effect of challenges to core beliefs on both variables, this study suggests that this effect has only a minor influence on PTSD, in addition to confirming its major impact on PTG.",973

However, other internalizing symptoms such as anxiety or post-traumatic stress and individual difference variables such as personality traits and alcohol use may contribute to stressful life events. Whether stress generation is specific to depression or generalized to these other variables is unclear. Therefore, we tested whether stress generation was depression specific or generalizable to anxiety, PTSD, alcohol use, neuroticism, and extraversion.Two-wave longitudinal study with a five-year follow-up.917 young adults completed measures of internalizing symptoms, alcohol use, neuroticism, and extraversion during college and five years later along with an interview-based measure of life events.Symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and neuroticism exhibited bivariate predictive effects on interpersonal-dependent events. When considering internalizing symptoms in the aggregate, stress generation was specific to symptoms rather than neuroticism. Furthermore, interpersonal-dependent life events mediated Time 1 internalizing symptoms predicting Time 2 symptoms.Our results indicate that stress generation applies to internalizing symptoms broadly rather than specifically to depression. Moreover, neuroticism was no longer a significant predictor of life events when examined with internalizing symptoms simultaneously. These results support the value of integrative models that test numerous factors predicting stressful life events.",974

Objective: To assess the effectiveness of an intensive trauma-focused treatment programme combining two evidence-based trauma-focused therapies and physical activities for adolescents suffering from severe PTSD. Method: Treatment consisted of daily sessions of prolonged exposure (PE) therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy supplemented with physical activity (13 days on average). All patients (N = 27; 96.3% women, mean age = 16.1 years; SD = 1.3) had been exposed to one or more (interpersonal) traumatic events. Twenty-two of them (81.5%) also fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of a comorbid psychiatric disorder (mean number of comorbid disorders = 2.22). The majority of patients were referred because previous treatment was difficult or complications were expected to occur. Severity of PTSD symptoms and presence of a PTSD diagnostic status were assessed using the Dutch version of the CAPS-CA IV at baseline, post-treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Results: CAPS-CA IV scores decreased significantly from pre- to post-treatment (Cohen's d = 1.39). Of all patients 81.5% (n = 22) showed a clinically meaningful response, of whom 63% (n = 17) no longer fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of PTSD at post-treatment as established with the CAPS-CA IV. The results were maintained at 3-month follow-up. During treatment, neither adverse events nor dropout occurred. Conclusions: The results suggest that an intensive trauma-focused treatment programme combining prolonged exposure, EMDR therapy, and physical activity can be an effective and safe treatment for adolescents suffering from severe PTSD and multiple comorbid psychiatric disorders.Antecedentes: Después de los efectos prometedores de un tratamiento intensivo del trauma para adultos, surge la pregunta de si los adolescentes que padecen un trastorno de estrés postraumático severo (TEPT) también pueden beneficiarse de un programa de tratamiento similar.Objetivo: Evaluar la efectividad de un programa de tratamiento intensivo centrado en el trauma que combina dos terapias centradas en el trauma basadas en la evidencia y actividad física para adolescentes que sufren de TEPT grave.Método: El tratamiento consistió en sesiones diarias de terapia de exposición prolongada (PE) y terapia de desensibilización y reprocesamiento por movimientos oculares (EMDR) complementadas con actividad física (13 días en promedio). Todos los pacientes (N = 27; 96.3% mujeres, edad media = 16,1 años; DE = 1.3) habían estado expuestos a uno o más eventos traumáticos (interpersonales). Veintidós de ellos (81.5%) también cumplían los criterios diagnósticos de un trastorno psiquiátrico comórbido (número medio de trastornos comórbidos = 2.22). La mayoría de los pacientes fueron derivados porque el tratamiento previo fue difícil o se esperaba que ocurrieran complicaciones. La gravedad de los síntomas de TEPT y la presencia del diagnóstico de TEPT se evaluaron utilizando la versión holandesa del CAPS-CA IV al inicio, después del tratamiento y a los 3 meses de seguimiento.Resultados: Los puntajes de CAPS-CA IV disminuyeron significativamente pre a post tratamiento (d de Cohen = 1,39).

To date, no study has examined predominant PTSD typologies using DSM-5 criteria. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify typologies of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms in 158 U.S. veterans who screened positive for this condition. A three-class solution provided the best fit to the data, described as Dysphoric (36.2%), High Symptom (34.0%) and Threat (29.8%). The Threat class had higher probabilities of intrusions and avoidance compared to the Dysphoric class; the Dysphoric class had higher probabilities of negative affect, anhedonia and externalizing behavior relative to Threat; the High Symptom class had high probabilities of all symptoms. Compared to the Threat class, the Dysphoric class was more likely to have a lifetime history of major depressive, alcohol and drug use disorders; the High Symptom class was more likely to have a lifetime history of alcohol, drug, and nicotine use disorder, current generalized anxiety, or to have attempted or currently contemplated suicide. The High Symptom class reported greater mental, physical and cognitive impairment and lower quality of life. These findings underscore the importance of a personalized approach to the assessment and treatment of DSM-5 PTSD.",976

This was a longitudinal study with 226 bereaved survivors sampled at 6 months and 18 months post-earthquake. The instrument used in the study was the revised version of the Impact of Event Scale. The results showed that the prevalence of probable PTSD in bereaved survivors decreased significantly from 38.9% at 6 months to 16.8% at 18 months post-earthquake. Loss of a child, being directly exposed to the death of family members and property loss during the earthquake, and mental health services utilization after the earthquake were significant predictors for PTSD severity at both assessments. These findings can contribute to post-disaster psychological rescue work. The bereaved survivors at high risk for more severe PTSD should be particularly targeted.

This randomized clinical trial compared an online, coach-assisted cognitive behavioral intervention tailored for women Veterans with PTSD to phone monitoring only.Women Veterans who met diagnostic criteria for PTSD were randomized to an 8-week web-based intervention, called DElivery of Self TRaining and Education for Stressful Situations (DESTRESS)-Women Veterans version (WV), or to phone monitoring only (N = 102). DESTRESS-WV consisted of online sessions and 15-min weekly phone calls from a study coach. Phone monitoring included 15-min weekly phone calls from a study coach to offer general support. PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Symptom-Checklist-Version 5 [PCL-5]) was evaluated pre and posttreatment, and at 3 and 6 months posttreatment.More participants completed phone monitoring than DESTRESS-WV (96% vs. 76%, p = 0.01), although treatment satisfaction was significantly greater in the DESTRESS-WV condition. We failed to confirm the superiority of DESTRESS-WV in intent-to-treat slope changes in PTSD symptom severity. Both treatments were associated with significant reductions in PTSD symptom severity over time. However, post hoc analyses of treatment completers and of those with baseline PCL ≥ 33 revealed that the DESTRESS-WV group had greater improvement in PTSD symptom severity relative to phone monitoring with significant differences at the 3-month follow-up assessment.Both DESTRESS-WV and phone monitoring resulted in significant improvements in women Veterans' PTSD symptoms. DESTRESS-WV may be an appropriate care model for women Veterans who can engage in the demands of the treatment and have higher baseline symptoms. Future research should explore characteristics of and the methods of reliably identifying women Veterans who are most likely to benefit.

However, the effect of recurrent trauma on these long-term outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that trauma patients with a history of prior traumatic injury (PTI) would have poorer outcomes 6 months (6mo) after injury compared with patients without PTI.Adult trauma patients admitted at an urban, academic, Level I trauma center were screened for inclusion (October 2020 to November 2021). Enrolled patients were administered the PROMIS-29 instrument, the primary care post-traumatic stress disorder screen, and standardized questions about prior trauma hospitalization, substance use, employment, and living situation at baseline and 6mo after injury. Assessment data was merged with clinical registry data, and outcomes were compared with respect to PTI.Of 3,794 eligible patients, 456 completed baseline assessments and 92 completed 6mo surveys. Between those with or without PTI, there were no differences at 6mo after injury in the proportion of patients reporting poor function in social participation, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, or sleep disturbance. Prior traumatic injury patients reported poor physical function less often than patients without PTI (10 [27.0%] vs. 33 [60.0%], p = 0.002). After controlling for age, gender, race, injury mechanism, and Injury Severity Score, PTI correlated with a fourfold decrease in poor physical function risk (adjusted odds ratio, 0.243; 95% confidence interval, 0.081-0.733; p = 0.012) in the multivariable logistic regression model.Compared with patients suffering their first injury, trauma patients with PTI have better self-reported physical function after a subsequent injury and otherwise equivalent outcomes across a range of HRQoL domains at 6mo. There remains substantial room for improvement to mitigate the long-term challenges faced by trauma patients and to facilitate their societal reintegration, regardless of the number of times they are injured.Prognostic and Epidemiological; Level III.",979

This analysis used the victimized subsample ( N = 752) of the Sexual Assault Among Latinas Study. The aim was to evaluate victimization prevalence and test the following hypotheses: (a) that victimization would be associated with higher levels of posttraumatic symptoms, (b) that cultural factors that move away from traditional Latino culture would be associated with higher levels of posttraumatic symptomatology, and (c) that cultural factors associated with traditional Latino culture would be related to lower posttraumatic symptomatology. Average age of the sample was 44.57 years, with three fourths having a high school education or higher, and two thirds having a household income below $30,000. Of exposure types, adulthood threats were most likely to result in Criterion A traumatic events (23.4%). Using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) based PTSD Checklist, between 8.8% and 45.5% of individuals met presumed PTSD diagnosis based on various PCL cut scores or algorithm criteria.

Therefore, the study of the elements that can characterize the disorder could be considered of great clinical interest and relevance. The aim of the present research was to empirically discriminate the influence of perceived stress, state anxiety, worry, and defense mechanisms (mature, neurotic, and immature) at different levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. A sample of 1250 participants (69.5% women, 30.5% men; Mage = 34.52, SD = 11.857) completed an online survey including the Impact of Event Scale—Revised, Ten-Item Perceived Stress Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, Forty Item Defense Style Questionnaire, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory—Form X3. Data were analysed by implementing MANOVA and discriminant analysis. Results showed significant differences in the levels of perceived stress, state anxiety, and worry, as well as neurotic and immature defenses based on the levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms: F(12,2484) = 85.682, p &lt; 0.001; Wilk’s Λ = 0.430. Furthermore, these variables discriminate significant accuracy between participants who reported a mild psychological impact and those with a probable presence of PTSD, with perceived stress, which was found to be the best predictor.

Knowledge about temporal relationships between PGD, PTSD, and depression is limited by a lack of relevant studies and diverse or inappropriate assessment time frames given the duration criterion for PGD. We aimed to determine the temporal reciprocal relationships between PGD, PTSD, and depressive symptoms among ICU decedents' family surrogates during their first 2 bereavement years with an assessment time frame reflecting the PGD duration criterion.This prospective, longitudinal, observational study examined PGD, PTSD, and depressive symptoms among 303 family surrogates of ICU decedents from two academic hospitals using 11 items of the Prolonged Grief Disorder-13, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively, at 6, 13, 18, and 24 months post-loss. Cross-lagged panel modeling was conducted: autoregressive coefficients indicate variable stability, and cross-lagged coefficients indicate the strength of reciprocal relationships among variables between time points.Symptoms (autoregressive coefficients) of PGD (0.570-0.673), PTSD (0.375-0.687), and depression (0.591-0.655) were stable over time. Cross-lagged standardized coefficients showed that depressive symptoms measured at 6 months post-loss predicted subsequent symptoms of PGD (0.146) and PTSD (0.208) at 13 months post-loss. PGD symptoms did not predict depressive symptoms. PTSD symptoms predicted subsequent depressive symptoms in the second bereavement year (0.175-0.278). PGD symptoms consistently predicted subsequent PTSD symptoms in the first 2 bereavement years (0.180-0.263), whereas PTSD symptoms predicted subsequent PGD symptoms in the second bereavement year only (0.190-0.214). PGD and PTSD symptoms are bidirectionally related in the second bereavement year.PGD, PTSD, and depressive symptoms can persist for 2 bereavement years. Higher PGD symptoms at 6 months post-loss contributed to the exacerbation of PTSD symptoms over time, whereas long-lasting PTSD symptoms were associated with prolonged depression and PGD symptoms beyond the first bereavement year. Identification and alleviation of depression and PGD symptoms as early as 6 months post-loss enables bereaved surrogates to grieve effectively and avoid the evolution of those symptoms into long-lasting PGD, PTSD, and depression.",982

We also tested the hypothesis that unwillingness to be in contact with distressing thoughts and feelings—i.e. experiential avoidance—would moderate the relationship between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and growth. Methods This study was carried out with 187 patients. Patients completed the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) 5 months after HSCT and scales tapping into the five domains of PTGI during hospitalisation and 5 months after HSCT. Mental health and psychological disposition were also assessed prior to hospitalisation. A PTSD scale was administered at the five-month follow-up. Results Prospective and retrospective measures of PTG were weakly correlated. Bayesian pre/post-HSCT comparisons in the prospective measure of PTG revealed substantial to very strong decline in four of the five dimensions assessed. Overall, RCI indicated a reliable increase for 5.6% of patients and a reliable decrease for 40.8% of patients. Confirming that retrospective and prospective measures of PTG reflect different processes, they were not related to the same mental health and psychological disposition variables. Moreover, the hypothesis that acquiring positive outcomes from a potentially traumatic experience, such as HSCT, requires direct confrontation with the source of distress was supported in the case of the retrospective measure of growth but not in the case of the prospective measure growth. Conclusions Retrospective measures such as the PTGI do not appear to assess actual pre- to post-HSCT change. HSCT seems more linked to psychological decline than to growth.",983

To explore the dynamic change and relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cognition in patients transferred from ICU.


Methods
Participants patients were selected from Critical Medical Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University by convenience sampling method between October 2016 to February 2017. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the PTSD Cheeklist-Vivilian Version (PCL-C) were used to collect data at 3 days, 3 months and 6 months after transferring from ICU.


Results
The incidence of cognitive disorder at 3 time points were 29.4% (30/102) , 20.0% (18/90) , 17.8% (13/73) respectively, and MoCA scores was 25.83±6.29,28.57±5.43,28.86±5.11, the difference was significant (F=6.204, P<0.01). The incidence of PTSD symptoms were 42.2% (43/102) , 23.3% (21/90) , 19.2% (14/73) respectively, and PCL-C scores was 35.24±5.94, 28.68±5.13, 26.92±4.85, the difference was significant (F=10.125, P<0.01). There were significant relationship between cognition and PTSD level (r=0.299-0.543, P <0.05). The PTSD level in cognitive disorder patients was 37.52±5.88, 31.15±5.12, 29.84±4.82, and that in non-cognitive disorder patients was 34.32±5.76, 27.68±4.91, 25.74±4.59 the difference was significant (t=2.117, 2.651, 3.334, P<0.05).


Conclusions
Health workers should pay attention to the mental status and cognitive impairment of patients transferred from ICU, implement psychological and cognitive interventions early, which could improve the cognitive status and PTSD progression of patients, and improve their quality of life.

The treatment was not phase-based in that it did not contain a stabilization phase or skill training prior to therapy. CPTSD diagnosis was assessed by means of the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) and PTSD diagnosis was assessed with both the ITQ and CAPS-5. Treatment response was measured with the CAPS-5, PCL-5, and ITQ.Results Symptoms of both PTSD and CPTSD significantly decreased from pre- to post-treatment resulting in a significant loss of CAPS-5 based PTSD (74.0%) and ITQ-based PTSD and CPTSD diagnoses (85.0% and 87.7%, respectively).

Applying the DSM‐5 criteria to assess traumatic events and stressor‐related disorders in cancer survivors,"The rather broad definition of medical trauma within DSM-IV has contributed to long-lasting debates on the applicability of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in oncological patients and its differentiation from Adjustment Disorder (AjD) which results from non-traumatic critical life events. The DSM-5 criteria have introduced a narrower definition of medical traumatization. However, studies on updated prevalence rates in cancer patients are missing.Within a cross-sectional study, we assessed hematological cancer survivors using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. We investigated (i) the frequency and type of cancer-related stressors, (ii) the proportion of stressors qualifying as traumatic according to DSM-5 (i.e., an event of sudden and catastrophic character) and (iii) the prevalence of PTSD, AjD and cancer-related PTSD according to DSM-5.291 patients participated (response rate: 58%). Mean age was 54 years, 60% were male. 168 patients (59%) reported cancer-related stressors, with the most frequent being cancer diagnosis disclosure (n = 58, 27%). Eight percent of reported stressors qualified as traumatic events according to DSM-5. Five (1.8%), 15 (5.3%) and 20 (7.0%) cancer survivors met DSM-5 criteria for current PTSD, lifetime PTSD and AjD, respectively. Among all PTSD cases, three were cancer-related (1.1%). In addition, seven patients (2.5%) met all symptoms for cancer-related PTSD, but not the DSM-5 criterion for medical trauma. Considering receiving the cancer diagnosis as traumatic event, which is debatable according to DSM-5, 38% of stressors qualified as traumatic and six patients (2.1%) met criteria for cancer-related PTSD.DSM-5 criteria enable a clear identification of traumatic events in the context of cancer. This change may inform discussions on the appropriateness of PTSD in cancer patients and facilitates its differentiation from AjD. Larger studies need to validate our findings.",986

Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are evident in a significant proportion of women after having experienced diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Several risk factors for developing longterm PTSS after breast cancer have been identified. Younger age, low education and income, pre-cancer previous psychiatric history, cancer disease severity, poor physical functioning, and acute symptoms of PTSS are predictors of long-term post-cancer PTSS, with poor physical functioning and acute PTSS as the strongest predictors in a large population-based cohort of women treated for breast cancer. Women characterized by these factors may be at risk of developing long-term PTSS after breast cancer and are likely to benefit from evidence-based psychological interventions for PTSS. A strategy for screening for risk of long-term PTSS to identify the women who are most likely to benefit from psychological intervention is suggested. Until further research has been conducted and more firm conclusions can be drawn regarding which interventions strategies are most effective, it is recommended that therapists select the evidence-based method that fits both patient and therapist the best.",987

Using secondary data from the NIDA-funded Women and Trauma Study, we demonstrated Common Persons Item Response Theory (IRT) Calibration for calibrating self-reported and clinician-reported PTSD severity scores in a manner similar to the process used to produce equated scores across multiple forms of standardized tests (e.g., SAT, GRE). Under IRT calibration, treatment effect sizes between the CAPS and MPSS-SR did not differ, while with the noncalibrated measures, the CAPS effect size was 85% larger than the MPSS-SR. Further, across the range of a combined CAPS/MPSS-SR gold standard, IRT-calibrated CAPS and MPSS-SR individual scores did not differ; for uncalibrated individual scores, MPSS scores were higher than CAPS scores at higher levels of PTSD severity while the reverse was true at lower levels of severity. The use of IRT calibration approaches for calibrating self-report and clinical interview measures of PTSD will allow treatment researchers to reflect the treatment effect on PTSD as a construct (regardless of reporter) as opposed to being limited to reporting treatment effects that may be discrepant within patients and specific to the particular assessment measure being employed.

Different research on PTSD symptoms structure proved the better fit of four-factor and five-factor models comparing to the one proposed by DSM-IV. With the publication of DSM-5 classification, which introduced significant changes to PTSD diagnosis, the question arises about the adequacy of the proposed criteria to the real structure of disorder symptoms. Recent analyses suggest that seven-factor hybrid model is the best reflection of symptoms structure proposed to date. At the same time, some researchers and ICD-11 classification postulate a simplification of PTSD diagnosis restricting it to only three core criteria and adding additional diagnostic unit of complex-PTSD. This research aimed at checking symptoms' structure according to well-known and supported four-, five-, six- and seven-factor models based on DSM-5 symptoms and the conceptualization proposed by the ICD-11 as well as examining the relation between PTSD symptoms categories with borderline personality disorder. Four different trauma populations were examined with self-reported Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5 (PDS-5) measure. The results suggest that six- and seven-factor hybrid model as well as three-factor ICD-11 concept fits the data better than other models. The core PTSD symptoms were less related to borderline personality disorder than other, broader, symptoms categories only in one sample. Combination of ICD-11 simplified PTSD diagnosis with the more complex approach (e.g. basing on a seven-factor model) may be an attractive proposal for both scientists and practitioners, however does not necessarily lower its comorbidity with borderline personality disorder.",989

We compared cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) each to an individual psychotherapy comparator group, and CPT to PE in a large national healthcare system. Methods We utilized effectiveness and comparative effectiveness emulated trials using retrospective cohort data from electronic medical records. Participants were veterans with PTSD initiating mental healthcare ( N = 265 566). The primary outcome was PTSD symptoms measured by the PTSD Checklist (PCL) at baseline and 24-week follow-up. Emulated trials were comprised of ‘person-trials,’ representing 112 discrete 24-week periods of care (10/07–6/17) for each patient. Treatment group comparisons were made with generalized linear models, utilizing propensity score matching and inverse probability weights to account for confounding, selection, and non-adherence bias. Results There were 636 CPT person-trials matched to 636 non-EBP person-trials. Completing ⩾8 CPT sessions was associated with a 6.4-point greater improvement on the PCL (95% CI 3.1–10.0). There were 272 PE person-trials matched to 272 non-EBP person-trials. Completing ⩾8 PE sessions was associated with a 9.7-point greater improvement on the PCL (95% CI 5.4–13.8). There were 232 PE person-trials matched to 232 CPT person-trials. Those completing ⩾8 PE sessions had slightly greater, but not statistically significant, improvement on the PCL (8.3-points; 95% CI 5.9–10.6) than those completing ⩾8 CPT sessions (7.0-points; 95% CI 5.5–8.5). Conclusions PTSD symptom improvement was similar and modest for both EBPs. Although EBPs are helpful, research to further improve PTSD care is critical.",990

The sample included 2,029 police responders and 2,167 nontraditional responders. Current (past-month) probable WTC-related PTSD level (none, subthreshold, or full PTSD) was assessed based on DSM-IV criteria using the PTSD Checklist-Specific Stressor version (PCL-S). Results: The prevalence of current probable full and subthreshold WTC-related PTSD in police responders was 9.3% and 17.5%, respectively, and in nontraditional responders was 21.9% and 24.1%, respectively. Risk and protective correlates for subthreshold PTSD included post-9/11 medical comorbidities and traumatic events (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.1-1.2). Clinical characteristics included elevated rates of comorbid depression (OR = 3.2 and 3.9 for subthreshold PTSD and 17.2 and 30.3 for full PTSD for nontraditional and police responders, respectively). Among responders with subthreshold PTSD, police were more likely to have accessed mental health services and utilized a greater variety of treatments than nontraditional responders. Conclusions: Overall, 26.8% of police and 46.0% of nontraditional responders met criteria for probable WTC-related full or subthreshold PTSD an average of 12 years after 9/11. Probable subthreshold PTSD, which is not typically assessed in clinical settings, was more prevalent than probable full PTSD and was associated with significantly elevated rates of psychiatric comorbidities, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life. These findings underscore the importance of assessing, monitoring, and possibly treating subthreshold PTSD in WTC and other disaster responders.",992

Trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms were assessed using two previously validated measures, the Brief Trauma Questionnaire and Short Screening Scale for DSM-IV PTSD. Average PA (hours/week) was assessed using self-report measures at six time points across 20 years (1989–2009). Linear mixed models with time-updated PTSD assessed differences in PA trajectories by trauma/PTSD status. Among a subsample of women whose trauma/PTSD onset during follow-up, group differences in PA patterns before and after onset were assessed using linear spline models.ResultsPA decreased more steeply over time among trauma-exposed women reporting four or five (β= –2.5E–3, SE=1.0E–3, p=0.007) or six or seven PTSD symptoms (β= –6.7E–3, SE=1.1E–3, p<0.001) versus women without trauma exposure, adjusting for potential confounders. Among a subsample of women whose trauma/PTSD symptoms onset during follow-up, no differences in PA were observed prior to onset; after onset, women with six or seven PTSD symptoms had a steeper decline (β= –17.1E–3, SE=4.2E–3, p<0.001) in PA over time than trauma-exposed women without PTSD.ConclusionsDecreases in PA associated with PTSD symptoms may be a pathway through which PTSD influences cardiovascular and other chronic diseases.",994

A multisite study assessing the latent structure of the proposed ICD-11 and DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD,"Background: Researchers and clinicians within the field of trauma have to choose between different diagnostic descriptions of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the DSM-5 and the proposed ICD-11. Several studies support different competing models of the PTSD structure according to both diagnostic systems; however, findings show that the choice of diagnostic systems can affect the estimated prevalence rates. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the potential impact of using a large (i.e. the DSM-5) compared to a small (i.e. the ICD-11) diagnostic description of PTSD. In other words, does the size of PTSD really matter? Methods: The aim was investigated by examining differences in diagnostic rates between the two diagnostic systems and independently examining the model fit of the competing DSM-5 and ICD-11 models of PTSD across three trauma samples: university students (N = 4213), chronic pain patients (N = 573), and military personnel (N = 118). Results: Diagnostic rates of PTSD were significantly lower according to the proposed ICD-11 criteria in the university sample, but no significant differences were found for chronic pain patients and military personnel. The proposed ICD-11 three-factor model provided the best fit of the tested ICD-11 models across all samples, whereas the DSM-5 seven-factor Hybrid model provided the best fit in the university and pain samples, and the DSM-5 six-factor Anhedonia model provided the best fit in the military sample of the tested DSM-5 models. Conclusions: The advantages and disadvantages of using a broad or narrow set of symptoms for PTSD can be debated, however, this study demonstrated that choice of diagnostic system may influence the estimated PTSD rates both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the current described diagnostic criteria only the ICD-11 model can reflect the configuration of symptoms satisfactorily. Thus, size does matter when assessing PTSD.Planteamiento: Los investigadores y clínicos del campo del trauma pronto decidirán entre dos descripciones diagnósticas diferentes del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) en el DSM-5 y la propuesta CIE-11. Varios estudios apoyan diferentes modelos en competencia sobre la estructura del TEPT en función de ambos sistemas de diagnóstico; sin embargo, los resultados demuestran que la elección de los sistemas de diagnóstico puede afectar las tasas de prevalencia estimadas. Objetivos: y métodos. El presente estudio tenía como objetivo investigar el impacto potencial de usar una descripción del TEPT amplia (es decir, el DSM-5) en comparación con una pequeña (es decir, la CIE-11). En otras palabras, ¿el tamaño del TEPT importa realmente? El objetivo se investigó mediante el examen de las diferencias en las frecuencias de diagnóstico entre los dos sistemas de diagnóstico y examinando de forma independiente cómo se ajustaban los modelos en competencia para el TEPT del DSM-5 y la CIE-11 en tres muestras de trauma: estudiantes universitarios (N = 4213), pacientes con dolor crónico (N = 573) y personal militar (N = 118). Resultados: Las tasas diagnósticas del TEPT fueron significativamente más bajas según los criterios de la propuesta CIE-11 en la muestra universitaria, pero no se encontraron diferencias significativas para los pacientes con dolor crónico y el personal militar. El modelo de tres factores propuesto por la CIE-11 proporcionó el mejor ajuste de los modelos de la CIE-11 que fueron probados en todas las muestras. En cambio, el modelo híbrido de siete factores del DSM-5 proporcionó el mejor ajuste en las muestras universitaria y del dolor, y el modelo de Anhedonia de seis factores del DSM-5 en la muestra militar de los modelos probados del DSM-5. Conclusiones: Se pueden debatir las ventajas y desventajas de utilizar un conjunto amplio o reducido de síntomas para el TEPT; sin embargo, este estudio demostró que la elección del sistema de diagnóstico puede influir en las tasas estimadas del TEPT, tanto cualitativa como cuantitativamente. Al mismo tiempo, parece que, dados los criterios diagnósticos descritos actualmente, solo el modelo de la CIE-11 puede reflejar satisfactoriamente la configuración de los síntomas. Por lo tanto, el tamaño importa cuando se evalúa el TEPT.背景：在创伤领域的研究者和临床工作者很快要在DSM-5和ICD-11提案种对两个不同的创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)诊断描述做出选择。一些研究根据不同的诊断系统支持不同的PTSD症状结构的竞争模型，但是研究发现显示不同的诊断系统的选择会影响对发生率的估计。 目标和方法：本研究旨在探究使用大量（如DSM-5）或者少量（如ICD-11）PTSD症状描述的潜在影响。换言之，PTSD的症状量是否真的重要？我们考察在两个不同诊断系统里的诊断率的差别，并分别在三个创伤样本里考察DSM-5和ICD-11 的PTSD竞争模型的拟合性：大学生样本（N=4213），长期疼痛病人（N=573）和军人样本（N=118）。 结果：在大学生样本里根据ICD-11提案的PTSD的诊断率显著更低，但是对长期疼痛病人和军人样本没有显著差别。ICD-11提案的三因子模型跨样本拟合最好，但DSM-5七因子混合模型在大学生和疼痛样本中拟合最好，DSM-5 六因子快感缺失模型在军人样本中拟合最好。 结论：使用一个广泛或者狭窄的PTSD症状集的优劣是可以争论的，但是本研究显示对诊断体系的选择可以从质性和量化角度影响对PTSD患病率的估计。同时，在目前的诊断标准中只有ICD-11模型可以令人满意地反映症状结果。因此在评估PTSD时，症状数量是重要的。.",995

Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional study was conducted, which involved 100 firefighters from the state of Selangor, Malaysia. Construct validity, internal consistency, and concurrent validity were performed and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Concurrent validity was tested with validated Malay version of Trauma Screen Questionnaire (TSQ-M). Findings Overall internal consistency reliability was a 0.960 and individual construct Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.827 to 0.926. The model, which consists of four constructs with 20 items, demonstrated the presence of acceptable loading factors. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) are 0.81, 0.65, 0.31 and 0.95 respectively at an optimum cut-off score of 35. Research limitations/implications The Post Traumatic Check List 5 (PCL-5) is the latest tool based on DSM-5 developed recently and still having limited studies on the psychometric properties of the tool in local population and the findings produced are comparable with the results from validation from previous studies. The study limitations are population samples used are considering the minimum numbers of sample for each item for factor analysis and the concurrent validation was tested with the TSQ-M instead of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Practical implications The study suggested that MPCL-5 is acceptable to be used to measure post-traumatic stress disorder in local populations. Originality/value There are limited known validation studies for PCL-5 in local populations and this is the first study done among fire and rescue officers in Malaysia. The results are comparable with findings from previous studies and therefore MPCL-5 are valid and reliable for PTSD screening.",996

In a prospective longitudinal study, we assessed diagnosed PTSD and clinically significant self-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in 90 children (11-22 years of age, 60% boys), 2-4 years after their accident (mean number of months 32.9, SD 6.6). The outcome was compared to the first assessment 3 months after the accident in 147 children, 8-18 years of age. The prevalence of PTSD was 11.6% at first assessment and 11.4% at follow-up. Children with PTSD or PTSS reported significantly more permanent physical impairment than children without. Children who completed psychotherapy had no symptoms or low levels of symptoms at follow-up. Given the long-term prevalence of PTSD in children following accidents, we recommend systematic monitoring of injured children. The role of possible associated factors in long-term PTSS needs further study.",997
https://openalex.org/W3211468537,10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102497,The latent structure of ICD-11 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD in a general population sample from USA: A factor mixture modelling approach,"The validity of ICD-11 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Complex PTSD (CPTSD), as measured by the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ; Cloitre et al., 2018) has been supported in many factor analytic and mixture modelling studies. There is, however, a paucity of research investigating the latent structure of the ITQ using factor mixture modelling (FMM). FMM was applied to data collected from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 1834). FMM results demonstrated strong support for a two-factor second-order model with four qualitatively distinct latent classes: a 'PTSD class', a 'CPTSD class', a 'DSO' (Disturbances in Self-Organisation) class and a 'low symptoms class'. Sexual abuse increased likelihood of membership to the 'CPTSD' (OR = 3.22) and physical abuse decreased likelihood of membership to the 'PTSD' (OR=0.51). Trauma exposure in adulthood predicted 'PTSD' and 'CPTSD' class membership. The 'CPTSD class' was characterised by higher levels of psychopathological co-morbidities and poorer psychological wellbeing compared to all other classes. Results provide additional support for the validity of PTSD and CPTSD as measured by the ITQ.",998

Using the 4-item Primary Care (PC)-PTSD screening tool, we evaluated the relationship between the number and type of PC-PTSD symptoms endorsed and a set of patient-reported outcomes, including: pain intensity and interference, function, mood, quality of life, and substance abuse risk in a consecutive sample of patients with chronic pain (n = 4,402). Patients completed PainTracker, a Web-based patient-reported outcome tool that provides a multidimensional evaluation of chronic pain, as part of their intake evaluation at a specialty pain clinic in a community setting. Twenty-seven percent of the sample met PC-PTSD screening criteria for PTSD by endorsing 3 of the 4 symptom domains. Significant ordinal trends were observed between increasing number of PTSD symptoms and all outcomes evaluated. The occurrence of even 1 PTSD symptom was associated with overall poorer outcomes, suggesting that subsyndromal PTSD is clinically significant in the context of chronic pain. Among the 4 PTSD domains assessed, “numbness/detachment” was most strongly associated with negative pain outcomes in relative weight analysis. Results from this cross-sectional study suggest that a range of pain-related outcomes may be significantly related to comorbid PTSD. Perspective We present evidence that PTSD symptoms are significantly related to a broad set of pain-related patient-reported outcomes. These findings highlight the need to evaluate for PTSD symptoms in patients with chronic pain, especially feelings of numbness or detachment from others, to improve understanding and management of chronic pain.",999
